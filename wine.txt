lovely delicate fragrant rhone wine polished leather and strawberries perhaps a bit dilute but good for drinking now liquorice cherry fruit simple and coarse at the finish thin and completely uninspiring rough no stars big fat textured chardonnay nuts and butterscotch a slightly odd metalliccardboard finish but probably a blind tasting other than the fizz which included five vintages of cote rotie brune et blonde from guigal surprisingly young feeling and drinking well but without any great complexity a good charming violetfragranced nose classic guigal cote rotie good grip and a touch of rusticity on the length va showing through on the downhill slope just just about holding together drying out a touch at the finish not as good as i thought this would be a good in your face wine rather obvious and simple although some structure did begin to show through some volatility and all over the place on the nose and palate it did come together more with time gummy nose merlotstyle sweetness good wine but not in a style i was expecting hot on the palate but good balance with some maturity this has a rhonish air to it feels quite young but it is also a bit simple liquorice fruit beginning to dry out good sweetly fragranced wine drink now top a big nose of public swimming pools bizarre some might say funky very vinous burgundy with bubbles to some extent and so a bit much in some ways i suspect it needs time to mellow it will be interesting to see how this develops this bottle was disgorged only last year if all goes well all quite refined and delicate appley pinot fruit autolytic flavours another fairly recent disgorgement after 4 years in cellars credit the producer for an excellent back label it just seems a bit lacking in intensity despite the obvious quality perhaps this will develop but for now a good good fruit nice acidity pretty intense although it seems quite evolved for a young wine i fear it may go down the ozzy route of rather early flabby kerosene flavours top curiously sauvignonlike quite rich odd balance people were saying this is a vineyard huet took on and then abandoned good wine but it doesnt seem to have the class of their major wines a low pretty nice clean rich yet decently taught a credit to the appelation bare a weak cork and a rather oxidised bottle one sips for a while but then abandons it i have had much better not rated very light and delicate decent but a bit attenuated i have had better bottles dry savoury quite succulent pleasantly hightoned nervy and a bit awkward a wine with a sense of place and hence enjoyable curiously quiet but concentration and fruit quality are all there maybe just in a dull phase perhaps it would have shown better decanted and allowed a little air leafy dry decent balance good wine but i doubt its going anywhere much pleasant and perhaps it would reward further attention quite baked decent concentration slightly hot finish i recall having had better from this producer refined smooth sweet to a controlled extent very drinkable forward fruit but with the balance to hold it the best of the new world reds to my palate top huge monster alcohol gets up my a nose and in my throat rather i find this a bit much returning to it later it seemed to have mellowed quite a bit and to be a substantial wine in its way although i find it hard to decide about it many will admire this and i may too given time to consider it i had it eight and a half years ago and was impressed i think ill reserve judgement for now not rated a bit anonymous in some ways but very nicely poised fairly concentrated dessert wine from the south of france somewhere i guess i suspect this would repay more attention and on that basis beautifully refined complex elegant long with the amazing precision so typical of the producer lovely eccentric very rancio complex and interesting i need more time with this but for now raspingly dry mineral appley severe touch of honey developing long very fresh lifted aromatic top dry clean unassuming touch of spritz fruity peachy dry again more richness nice sense of place i could even think of quite mouthfilling dry fruity nice soft cigar cassis fruit sweet finish pleasant nice condition soft blackcurrant fruit with tannic background that starts to show in the midpalate odd balance a bit stinky at first resolves tar roses but the common old barolo oxidativeness tarry quite hard work actually probably good top rich again gamy animal dry could do with long decanting bare dark orange very barleysugar nice balance appetizing finish slightly lighter fruitier slightly oily textured bare a bit faded pleasant lightweight bare charming tempranillo sweet strawberry nose good balance and elegant a good modern stuff rather lacking depth and complexity at peak or just over rather like a decent cotesdurhone with a rustic edge pretty awful very soft and commercial confected a couple of wines from a big bash at an edinburgh hotel its a good idea once in a while to remember where the baseline is clean pretty dry but low on real concentration a respectable no stars clean again clearly rather dilute quite leafy and a touch of not necessarily bad greenness again a respectable no stars each done as a vertical single blind a slightly embarrassing start to the evening with people thinking this was vintage 1990 or 1996 possibly krug possibly billecart lovely wine whatever a touch of pink on the colour a blush to cover our blushes elegant good length and fine balanced acidity a really good cheap under 15 fizz mature with grenache cherry showing through charming nose slightly simple on the palate a good slightly flat liquorice nose more depth than the 98 closed up and allowing the alcohol to show through but i think this will come together well a touch gummy and with a hint of leather drier than many robust youthful obviously the youngest wine of this flight powerful wine with lovely softy tannins at the end past its peak although still very drinkable fruit is starting to dry out and a touch of volatility is appearing this vintage had a juiciness about the fruit that was lacking in the other wines but was also maturing well at an inbetween phase i guess corked not rated green tannins dry at the end a long soft not that pleasant leathery length vegetal blackcurrant soft and not together very young and closed minty but does it have the structure a stinky nose to start with leather and just beginning to dry out a touch vegetal and some volatility just a bit of blackcurrant clean and nicely together a top some thought this stunk rather i thought it the finest wine of this flight lovely fragrant mature shiraz nose at peak good toffeed bit dry volatile no stars cream crackers on the nose no thats not rhyming slang vanilla simple quite acidic some fruit a solid corked not rated simple cherry fruit and acidity rustic at the end sweet maturity at peak a top very slight almost unnoticeable spritz but otherwise mature and together and pleasant drinking a top young and closed but seemed a bit simple on the whole well made stuff but there does seem to be an odd dull metallic note to the wine otherwise there is soft wellbalanced fruit a good fruity balanced drink pleasant food or quaffing wine the usual penfolds style well made and with a touch of volatility helping with the balance dry clean nice piney is that allowed spicy perhaps is better reasonable complexity once it has warmed up above the icy temperature at which it was served decent length top nice whitepepper spicyness balanced and long the extreme nature of the vintage less apparent than i feared honied interesting greentinged hightoned fruit bonedry and rather nice time to drink though bare fresh grassy a bit vegetal fruity and a touch sweet top drier quite intense hints at almonds and lime slightly corked not rated a touch reductivesulphury forward fruit pleasantly dry top nice intensity aniseed fades a touch good value a touch of ginger rounded fruit like a topclass macon nice intensity and clean pretty dry palate very good intense pure cassis ripe with some quite dry succulent tannins fairly sweet impression on the palate sickly toffeefudge nose sweet fruit i dont like this sweet softdrink fruit it expands a bit but i still find it too soft for somebody who likes the style very sweet some mushroomyness but so sickly might almost be a desert wine i really dont want to drink this i cant even bring myself to give it stars on an if you like this sort of thing basis no stars quite sweet very soft fruit herby and lifted decent still a bit soft for my palate has mt e always been this easy certainly the best of the three bare almost madeiralike it suffered a bit on serving it was rather sedimenty pleasant but fading a bit almost dry nice but no better than it should be given the reputation of the vintage very classic cedary mature claret nose classic on the palate too but there is an air of living dangerously of corruption and a general hint that the wine will crack up really needs food now and probably should be drunk in the next year or two classic again on the nose but a rather fresher more stable palate with complex multifaceted fruit once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and hightoned drinking well and no hurry to consume this was one of three chapel down wines and a few refreshing and pleasing bottled beers supplied by the winery i dont get to try an awful lot of bacchus nowadays although way back i used to attend the english wine fair and try samples there i cant say i miss it much this wine is floral grapefruity and with hints of sauvignonlike flavours strangely for a cleanly made 11 white wine it isnt the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of its not unpleasant just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds hopefully the champagne style pinot that was also sent will be more interesting does wine travel well this champagne seems to have packing the car recently i opened up one of the underfoot storage compartments to pack a bottle of fizz when i found to my surprise a bottle already in there this i worked out had been in the car for the last couple of months going everywhere the car went a thousand miles or so in the cold and in the warm unfortunately i didnt have another untravelled bottle of this around for comparsion lovely fizz with good nutty steely age on the palate fine depth of flavour although the palate does tire very slightly at the end really on very good form good fruit and depth of colour very obvious new oak on the palate good drinkable modern wine fragrant dry palate quite meaty and serious time to drink i guess it will never be soft and the fruit is fully mature rather enjoyable i dont often drink village chablis this is a good example of what you get from a good one all the stony minerality and dryness of a premier cru but just a bit less intense and refined best with food seems a bit thin and mean straight from cellar but when it warms up its fantastic dry and succulent but with intense strawberry fruit and a bit of beetroot in the mouth quite structured it will probably improve a bit yet am i being overgenerous with quite tight and lean i wondered a bit whether it wasnt a little thin when judged by the highest standards but while not an absolute star more and more emerged with some breathing very welldefined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage top lovely bright crisp red fruits excellent concentration and balance great fruit but bone dry just a lovely village wine i thought at first but after some time to breath it seemed to have complexity and interest beyond that top top top quality creamy fruit lean complex and mineral with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage very good village wine good fruit and the fine acidity of the vintage delicious a good quite rich forward exotic fruit drinking nicely this bottle had been forgotten in a freezer overnight and then thawed didnt seem to have done much damage and as my host remarked its an easy way of opening the bottle pure quite mineral the fact that this is a no new oak wine very pleasingly evident quite a lot of richness to the fruit too specially once it had been open for half an hour could probably do with a couple of years and might age well for longer nice wine bare understated quite complex but a little flat and dominated by a carameltoffee overlay that im not keen on being a tempier fan i was expecting a lot from this but on this showing im not wildly keen dull very deepcoloured and tending to oxidation nothing like a couple of other halves of this from the same lot which were lovely an early case of poxy white burgundy or just a dodgy cork not rated attractive and drinkable but lacking the mineral complexity of the launois nv drunk recently pleasant mature rieslong needing drinking fairly soon bare writing up my notes from visiting dj in rully persuaded me to open this brought back from their cellars bright attractive and authentic but lacking any special buzz i wrote that on initially drinking a glass or two returning the following night this has opened out and is showing lovely minerality scrapes from a magnum well it was new years eve i think ive had this bottle for five plus years lovely stuff beautifully balanced could still have used a few more years a very easy deep colour very yeasty nose and honied appley fruit with bags of mushrooms evolved quite bold and rich long and delicious provided you like the meaty not so elegant bollinger style its not everyones glass of bubbles top quite elegant but rich some botrytis perhaps very fine mineral nice fruit dry and taught starting to drink nicely bare deep colour rather lovely gentle long mellow nutty and delightful some say a little lacking poise or complexity but i quite like it pure quite light and aetherial the vineyard perhaps nice length and texture pleasingly little oak still improving but may be wont merit another star pretty good dusty quite large but dry tending towards baked typical of the vintage a little chunky still pretty good quite a clarety style of burgundy bare closed at first but opens out lovely pure raspberry fruit hightoned very long needs a few more years to peak dry nice savoury but time to drink top colour tending to brown quite animal rich and decadent fades a bit in the glass and rapidly becomes cloying amazing dense young colour floral mineral tobacco iodine finish very fine indeed mineral nose rich cherry fruit hot iron finish fantastic interest packed with ripe tannins great balance but lots of potential top very easy silky forward touch of class i would like to try this from a stronger vintage and with a bit of age apricot fruit creamy texture and flavour no great complexity typical of eiswein lovely acidity bare as it opens up rather fine raspberry fruit touch of chocolate a bit spirity towards the end moderate weight now top very fresh lots of fizz touch of yeast etc a touch shorter and less weighty than the bolly in spectacularly good condition and with fine precise bready flavours lovely top from a half its usual reliable self fine bubbles and good mediumweight balance from a half simple and charming i love claret like this especially when the purpose of the evening is purely social rather than wine related this is at peak and a pleasure to drink ok stuff with decent fruit a touch coarse beautiful especially after a bottle of indifferent prosecco drunk with candied hibiscus flowers in the glass the lynchbages is elegant and suggests an inner depth that is not at present fully forthcoming hints of peach kernel and tempered steel poor alongside the lynchbages too soft and undemanding this needs a bit more time good structure and supple tannins medium length a good brought round by a friend for a sunday lunch a slight whiff of the farmyard when first opened but this cleared to reveal a lighttomedium weight claret with classic cigar box rich vanilla fruit excellent concentration not the last word in elegance and the mousse is a bit coarse but overall a splendid wine at least a good fruitcakey claret quite big and robust seems a little woody at first but returning a day later its clean nicelytoned mature wine chunky and in the final analysis not that complex but good vanillan lovely mousse very elegant understated class rich good riesling character quite a lot of residual sugar good in its way lovely fresh fruit complex delicate nose falls off a bit in the mouth opens out with some air and holds up well on returning after the other wines this is one of their lesser wines its a credit to the property rich lively smoky very nice less fine than the cubillo but richer from a half inky tannic plummy a bit baked lovely secondary characters merging suaver rounder suggestive of pomerol pure and a touch highertoned than the barton not ready but a bit shorterterm too top terribly refined mature claret great breed and balance i sometimes find pichon just a little too suave and lacking edge for my tastes but this is a super wine nice old nose a touch of tea good but doesnt develop on the palate creamy vanilla just a bit rubbery but that becomes less noticeable as it opens in the glass gamymineral yet edgy and unbalanced interesting yet also slightly flawed possibly a dodgy bottle top rich limey fruit youngseeming apple finish excellent marred ever so slightly by a raw woody background top a touch pruney and hard opens up a bit but remains a bit unsatifyingly remote i would expect more fresh fragrant raspberry nose fine elegany light palate joyfully lovely elegant as always silkytestured drinking wine but i dont feel this has the power for longterm evolution that say the 1990 has drinking nicely now top drinking from a half really beautifully now a delight i recall being a bit disappointed last time i drank one of these magnums this one however is delightful mature berryish st emilion breed and balance to the fore very good drinking top initially modern rich almost flashy later gamy not sure what to make of this its not like the vallana wines of old but it is quite substantial top pure luscious not really a keeper on this showing top funky showing age substantial but odd nicely integrated a touch sweet and easy perhaps but high quality top fragrant nose with a tar underlay hightoned pure yet quite gutsy tannins too persistent on the finish with chocolatey notes its pretty tightly wound still and a bit enigmatic my guess is a bare clean dry attractive very drinkable very pure hightoned yet silky fruit somewhat in the burgundian style but with roses tar and chocolate and noticable but ripe nebbiolo tannins on the other hand it has that floral scentedness of proper oldfashioned bordeaux doubtless worth keeping a few years but it is so wellmade it is a pleasure to drink now top perhaps starting to tire a bit nice fruit quite dryseeming now with a bit of pfalzy weight and a hint of hardness pleasant enough yeasty quite meaty rich needs a few years i havent had a recently purchased bottle of pol for a while and was surprised by its weight good though lovely sousbois and blackberry nose silky fruit ripe in the modern style with succulent tannins rather classy in a fairly modern way a quick thrash ongoogle reveals this one some sort of iwc trophy i can understand that not entirely my sort of thing but still perhaps worth a bare iodine and iron rich decadent fleshy fruitcake fruit good and time to drink bare tight acidity fine and intense ive been a bit upanddown about this wine but im sure i like this bottle perhaps even quite big a touch flabby rather evolved and vegetal im not sure what combination of producer vintage and possibly premature oxidation accounts for this being unfamiliar with the first two factors in this case still pretty drinkable bare lightweight feminine and fragrant although with quite a hard core running through it that suggests drinking with food modest acidity and so i am not sure how long this is for keeping very pleasant but without real distinction at the highest level top not very striking herby nose quite tight and nicely balanced for the vintage juicy succulent a touch of minerality very good drinking but will probably improve a bit yet an attractive combionation of piquant hightoned fruit with a lovely rounded ripeness very good for drinking over the next few years i think top domaine de la bon gran rather rich touch of botrytis probably pretty good really nice quite forward as the producers wines tend to be quite big but in balance no hint of the problems of the vintage top the second bottle of h lignier 1er cru from this vintage i have tried recently this is so pure digestible and generally fine but understated it doesnt shout and it doesnt have a particular note of individuality for me yet it is a complete wine that i like a lot beginning to drink well but not a longhaul wine top notably offdry still very fresh with rounded attractive fruit good lovely apple and cream nose slightly honied and a touch of yeast fine mousse too lovely a 939495 blend i believe top that old rioja nose of nuts and mushrooms and something slightly medical lovely very fresh nicely rounded fruit ultimately i suppose not complex enough to be a great wine but rather good bare good intensity the fruit has a distinct character mineral not fruitdriven something almost secondary about what is surely primary fruit very engaging top very gentle completely resolved pleasantly enjoyable all very lovely but despite the deftness of the touch of new barriques i feel it lacks the crystaline purity of his other wines an enigma that slightly flat souuthernfrench palate but with air an engaging herby nose is it going anywhere im not sure top lovely cherry fruit very attractive good syrah character fruitdriven but not to the point of undrinkability pleasant scrapes substantial and weighty notable botrytis interesting palate but perhaps tending towards rustic this was just a taste id be interested to try more fruit still has a lot of primary blackcurrant but the structure seems resolved so i guess this is for drinking now creamy some cigarbox all in all attractive fruit but a little too undemanding to rate a really high score top i guess i could get used to this trocken business this has good fruit and is bonedry without being harsh still fairly moderate alcohol at 12 the overall balance is good a year or two short of its peak i suspect blackberry fruit some oak i think quite tannic perhaps from the oak modernstyle an interesting expression of the langhe if with a modern tinge of new oak everything conterno makes iselegan and drinkable and this is no exception on the other hand i cant feel it is ultimately distinguished in the way that his barolos are a mix of four grape varietoes including nebbiolo bare round berry fruit quite a lot of blackcurrant some tobacco very nice mature claret if tending slightly towards the rustic lacks the fineness of a top wine good though quite spritzy initially but the next day that had dissipated and the honeysuckle soave charcter and pure fruit very evident good length too top this is better every time i try it class will out and i think it is le mesnil fruit that is giving it such minerality and complexity delicious my last bottle of this its really a relaxed fully mature attractive and balanced wine enough complexity to be interesting and the primary fruit that i remember being rather excessive years ago is now nicely in balance very good i notice in passing that it is a relativel modest 125 alcohol very classy pure blackberry and apple fruit demanding but ripe tannins very succulent really good dolcetto spritzy from dissolved co2 i guess excellent richness of fruit intensity and length nice sweetness balanced by really good acidity at least lovely bright appetising mosel wine yet with a rich fruitiness very attractive top the second time ive tried this recently its an ozzielike cabernet syrah blend but with a very unozzie dry palate seems to get better the longer it is open fine wine a dry dark olorosolike palate what a pc ought to have i guess but i often find them more amontillado there too as well as on the nose rather good 15 years old according to their web site top spicy riesling petrolly nose pretty dry good length but fairly simple and light again petrolly rather richer quite good concentration dry i wonder how this will go given it is already so petrolly honey and caramel butter less intense on the palate good less ambitious and benefits from that in fact reasonably concentrated and intense unusually intense vanilla nose damp straw quite heavytextured honied and rich charred nose and oily fruit big and long impressive in its way which is not my way bare berry nose oddly rasping finish minty similar finishes a bit abruptly minty a bit toffeed hightoned im not wild about this liquor blackberries mediumweight palate oddly bitter finish might be going to be rather good i keep getting this wine in situations where i cant sit backdrink a couple of glasses and think about it i must try and do that at some point dry pure wellmade balanced liquour raspberry again a bit thick softer and lacking the attack of the 2001 hints at mint again oddly twisty yet more balanced than the chileans quite fresh fruity strawlike hightoned rather nice pleasant and gracefully old perhaps going a bit flat top i spent the day moving paving slabs heavy and intense and making fish stock light and intense the stock was poured over some cod sea bass spinach and creme fraiche this isnt fine wine dairy but it does pay to get decent creme fraiche and then baked in the oven with a little grated parmesan stroganoff excellent cheeses from the cambridge cheese company and a passion fruit tart from maison blanc in oxford that my daughter was very passionate about followed good fizz which is perhaps just beginning to tire medium weight and with a hint of oxidation top rather simple after the de venoge lighter weight some complexity emerges after a while in the glass this was the sort of bottle you would avoid even on the most generous of binend offers the label stained and some evidence that the wine was seeping through the cork and dribbling down the capsule however the wine inside was lovely this was as tight a riesling as you could hope to taste with classic minerality and finely tuned acidity a really fine effort with time ahead one of those wines where the first sniff tells you that you are in the presence of something special glorious sweet st julien fruit with a palate that is on first taste deceptively simple none of the âtypical talbot whiff of the barnyard that broadbent notes but rather on this showing a wine of great purity and lasting structure superb and at a glorious peak from magnum i guess this was always going to be a come down after the previous wine i rather naughtily tasted them in this order when others at the table were more conventional in their drinking order this is reliable stuff that is drinking well with its tarry coffee and chocolate overtones good claret that enjoyable though it is i am drinking it whilst typing these notes gets relegated for now to the luncheon division a good from a half delicious and aging rather well good apricoty acidity and with a sweetness that is verging on being oversweet but which is contained within the framework of the wine i think this will age into something truly great showing its age with a tendency towards maderisation but very drinkable with yeasty rich fruit and good length like a viognier almost nicely intense top pure blackcherry fruit in profusion good concentration and so on with a slightly cassis character that seems quite common in modern wines how will this age i wonder probably quite well although the whole package is a bit soft for my taste top fragrant lightweight a very poor vintage of course no very great length needs drinking soon but it still has lovely minerality and is very stylish top meatier longer and generally a bit more substantial than the 93 with a slight bitterness on the finish that will probably ease further although the wine must be close to peak again so individual and so much a terroir wine i love it bare backward dense but fragrant and long coming towards peak really lovely this has rather a baked fruit character that i am not so keen on it is hard to taste against great wines like the gentaz but only a top fragrant dry and long more mineral and complex than the other ogier wines really lovely and should be drunk on its own away from the gentaz wines that tend to upstage it an absolute star that could even benefit from another year or two tremendous weight and concentrated minerality but all in balance fantastic top needs a swirl or two in the glass but characteristic cote rotie violets emerge very good top this has a solid core of fruit and the minerality and complexity that all the wines possess it is a touch harder and a touch less strong all round than the 89 however bare fragrant balanced easygoing wine with a nice dry finish good corked not rated awkwardly dry and rather short would go down quite well with food perhaps but not great hardly surprising given the vintage top asian spices as rp so often says fresh almost youthful still with fantastically long fruit gorgeous top oxidised might be an odd bottle so i wont rate it but of course at this age from this vintage they might all be this way not rated more awkward than the 85 it lacks that wines easy balance but this is really complex and the minerality is perhaps even more pronounced intellectual wine and really good more open and leafy lacks the poise of the best vintages but does give a long mineral mouthful top stuff but a little flabby and keroseney for a special cuvee from this producer top mineral broad intense with a restrained crystalline purity brilliant pale tangerine colour in a decanter intensely gingery on the nose as ramonets wines often are but to a grotesque degree rather horrible palate probably just oxidised but in a rather odd way a day later the oxidation aspect less apparent but still extravagently gingery and with a dull flatness no stars much more what one expects plenty of acid quite juicy nice fruit quite leafy liquid tobacco this seems to have gone backwards a bit since i last tasted it clearly needs a few years but good drinking now too according to the front label an original blend of 95 syrah according to the back label a wonderful accompaniment to chicken dishes goats cheese tart or full flavoured cheeses and suitable for vegetarians and vegans unlike the labelling the wine isnt too contrived good balance and good red fruit depth it will probably improve with a few years age by the way the other 5 is mouvedre sic just i wasnt expecting much of this sunday evening combined with a general foreboding about white rhones what a revelation though glorious full bodied stuff with a lovely toffee and honeysuckle length to the palate a wine i could drink and drink and not just on sundays good old fizz with touches of honey wood and aniseed medium bodied and with the acidity to keep the mature flavours together a disappointing wine in some sense quite winey and doesnt really have the class one expects relatively for a big name from 96 rather simple and lacking the drama and complexity of something to tuck away for the future possibly an off form bottle exotic rich oldfashioned splendid peachy exotic quite evolved made to drink fairly young but has that grand cru something about it bare so floral pure and beautiful intense dry approachable but lots of underlying structure completely gorgeous mineral very attractive drinking nicely rounder and a bit more concentrated mineral finish very good still fairly young much more reserved dense very concentrated more balanced than the 90 brilliant leaner sea breezes very classic lovely in time the 89 will be the better wine i guess lighter nose edgy finish not a bad 78 not edgy like the last time very fine piquant complex very classic thanks to everybody for bringing interesting and enjoyable wines and to centotre for feeding us well dry rich appetising long pretty nice i feel a bit of barrique aging is aiming at an international market but it is good id like to sit down and drink a few glasses one evening maybe even scrapes quite burgundian weight oaky but quite well handled chardonnay classy needs time though i find the tunina a bit more individual but this is pretty good bare as usual a melange of flavours delicious bare turkish delight dry could be a bit tiring although perhaps gewurz is ever that way nice balance of rosescented fruit with a dry palate good length another wine idlike to try properly a good bigscaled wine top chianti as id expect from this wine in such a fine vintage bare stinky at first blows off to reveal a really good taught balanced wine rather good i think bare herby good balance very drinkable suave silky dry quite structured easy a bit dry might improve but seems a bit austere but rather a nice nose scented nose but tannic serious i find the new oak tannins a bit more difficult young than the traditional style but the oak is done well and terroir shows through pretty concentrated fine wine this has quite a lot of quality and might evolve well in a sandrone sort of way light elegant quite fine i feel ive had slightly better bottles of this top more body but perhaps a touch less well delineated than the sandrone very nice approaching maturity bare so delicate mineral fine and long just ready a bit extracted and a bitter for my palate not my sort of thing although theres alot of wine in the glass perhaps i might warm to it with more time good dry savoury cooked fruits mushrooms nuts really good amarone maybe even nice way to finish wellbalanced and delicious top dry juicy mineral nicely made a bit thin on the midpalate initially but it fills out with time nice bare a bit more modernstyled pleasantly creamy good farmyardy mature burgundy quite piquant and perhaps a touch rough with marked tannins nice drinking but fades a little in the glass rather dilute dull and uninteresting past it horrible no stars a bit tough and tannic but with good texture could do with a bit more fruit more drinkable than i thought it would be not a star village an unrated vineyard and a moderate vintage its amazing what sensitive winemaking can achieve lovely drinkable engaging characterful and not entirely simple fuit nine years old and about at peak from a half really very enjoyable dense colour quite syrahlike at first but more baked almost burnt plum fruit after a while good texture feels nice in the mouth good structure too this is a rather good characterful wine still improving and needing time but perhaps it wont actually quite rate more stars really quite youthful still hightoned food wine with a touch of very italian bitterness nice fruit i described this as modern last time i drank it but it isnt evolving quickly merits a big hit of blackcurrant on the nose initially and a while after it still has quite a lot of forward fruit at least compared to the more austere highertoned 94 still a fine wine but im having trouble getting to grips with it say lovely hightoned brambly fruit with a touch of cranberry good ripeness and succulent tannins nice mineral base too probably still improving and could even rate another star in time for now a top my last bottle of this rich and flavoursome with highly evolved fruit on my first sip i thought it was past its best but on longer acquaintance i felt it was about at its best while needing drinking relatively soon top healthy colour cedary fruitcake nose and a pleasantly balanced palate pretty much at peak but holding nicely a bit of air and it opens up and reveals a fragrant side too i havent always been overwhelmed by the wines from this estate but this has shifted my opinion up a bit very pleasantly cedary but this bordeauxstyle wines fruit is becoming a bit thin now my last bottle of this lemony vanilla touch of sherry character but completely and enjoyably fresh and appetising almost timeless but i guess it wouldnt improve very pleasant mature wine of an unfashionable sort scented dry and savoury oldfashioned claret that isnt that weighty very pleasant but i think perhaps not one of the best wines from this property it is still improving but may not rate more stars i havent tasted this for eight years i think i rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich extravagently viscous texture theres a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish very lovely but i have slight reservations about the complexity it does seem as one might perhaps expect from the grape a touch onedimensional given its other qualities my first sampling of jadots beaujolais project my first thought was that i was expecting something a bit larger but the fruit has good understated concentration and there is an attractive mineral core too very drinkable yet there is a tannic underpinning that will give a at least a few years of positive evolution i am quite positive about htis for now a conservative lovely intense grenachebased wine long balanced like a very good chateauneuf easy top the lamaione is a disappointing wine i remember having it for the fist time before fwd in 1995 or earlier i guess then it oozed class and in 1997 i still rated it highly but since then it has declined and now one word will do undrinkable although ive expanded slightly beyond that below i wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making carb mac there arent many wines ive poured down the sink but this was one of them harsh and astringent completely gone no stars i dont want to be unfair to this wine it was a quick replacement for the undrinkable lamaione but this isnt quite of the standard that previous vintages of this wine used to be although possibly it is just a bit closed a really good bottle of this wine it seems in the past to have varied between 3 and 4 stars this one had the good strawberry leather nose of the best bottles leathery rustic and farmyardy not the most elagent wine ever but it never has been just touch of toast nice middle of the road champagne palate medium weight decent finish quite vinous nose chewy palate with some obvious wood influence good length top elegant ripe apples fine long finish excellent fine mousse not universally enjoyed perhpas becaus it could do with some time in bottle i like the style though scrapes seems good but very slightly tainted corked maybe but perhaps in fact excess sulphur takes the edge off not rated dry fragrant nice balance very toasty one gets used to it very tightly elegant and fine but it lacks sensory oomph a bit even though it is seriously concentrated loses fizz quite quickly i have slightly mixed feelings about this but maybe it needs further study top quite fullbodied a touch rustic perhaps there is something of maconwithbubbles about it but nevertheless its very drinkable good some lovely wine but also some disappointments ive had talbot gruaud larose and las cases 1982 in the last few months and whilst the first two have been stunning the last one is not showing well lovely together fizz good acidity elegant delicious weighty wine with a good heavy acidity stunning lovely riesling nose elegant palate acidity variable but the wine isnt getting flabby good wine with food garlic and chilli prawns but a bit simple dry finish unknit not really clear whether it has a direction dusty and drying out good but closed drinking beautifully easily the claret of the evening for drinking now textbook pauillac at a peak disappointing a touch volatile at the end weighty but it should be better than this good wine which others preferred more than me big and balanced from a half good botrytis but the acidity is lacking too heavily sweet for my tastes the last time i had this in 2002 it seemed a weedy wine that probably wasnt going to live to its youthful potential it just had the odd glimpse suggesting it might improve but i wasnt that convinced fortunately though this bottle at least is on lovely form a dry wine without flashiness but lovely toned acidity and flavours that are constantly developing in the glass and to think that i almost decided to drink all my bottles in 2002 an easy holding up well but so dull compared with the chateauneuf above simple sweet flavours i suppose attractive nutty marzipan tangy nose very nicelytextured palate with solid underlying fruit and a lovely salty finish all quite refined maybe scrapes not what i expected on opening oddly rounded fruit and a tired feeling after a while though it opens up quite nicely bonedry savoury citric a touch of herbs and a hint of fino sherry very nice and perhaps will even improve for now very luxurious agreeable oloroso that slips down a treat without generating the last word in excitement although its nose is pretty complex at least soon after opening say this wine has a touch of the lifted salty tang of manzanilla over a burnt oldwine palate with a long finish very mouthwatering a touch of camphor or something seems almost better after a day or two open very lovely easy very fine and long tangy hints of chocolate almost on the nose not quite as demanding as the coliseo from this house but very fine very drinkabe old sherry grippy and with that nice hint of sourness not the last word in fineness however i feel this hints a bit at drycleaning fluid rich and long with rather greater depth than a standard fino salty tang too nice acidity and a long citric finish very clean and pure not quite one thing or the other if you know what i mean vibrant ripe fruit to start with but with a green and dilute finish not as interesting as i would have hoped good fruit but perhaps a touch rustic old straw farmyard characters of a pleasant sort completely mature and very drinkable forgiving it a certain rusticity one might stretch to warm and ripe the vintage i guess but perhaps beginning to lose it in a graceful way cedary but not terribly complex bare seems pretty much ready to drink nice balance generous fruit and a nice dry finish bare lovely appetising drinkable wine breaking for another mouthful as i type not a hint of the varietal flab yet lovely ripe fruit and mineral overtones something of almonds about the whole package too this has the balance to keep well for a while i feel and it may even improve over a year or so dry yet not austere and with really good length classy clean fresh and simple wine with lightweight raspberry fruit a touch oxidised but i couldnt decide whether this was the winemaking or a duff bottle so until i get to try it again not rated from a magnum good sweet fruit chocolate and coffee good balance for drinking now top bone dry and with good intensity and length it just seems to lack a bit of pizzaz the whole effect is a touch but just a touch flat silkytextured and rich one feels this wine is part of the transition to a modern style here but this has produced a fine wine in this vintage voluptuous but still with enough stuffing nice mature riesling nose completely resolved and really quite soft and lovable top i have mixed feelings about this on the plus side fine nettlelike fruit nicely balanced now mature with a decent finish and a streak of minerality on the minus side a slight lack of real presence just a little underwhelming considering the reputation of the producer scrapes its easy to scoff at musar and until today i hadnt opened one of my own bottles for a year or two but its really not half bad you know rustic yes ultimately fairly simple yes but it does have lovely round sweet leathery fruit and it has aged very gracefully to a soft amberedged maturity so its easy to scoff in the other sense too some will say this is past its peak but i rather like it mature riesling apricot flavours old wine roundedness very pleasant quite big ripe and sweet for spatlese very attractive quite forward and engaging fruit very good rather than really riveting top quite big ripe and rich this has a timeless quality while showing some mature characters it is still quite sweet and very fresh it will benefit from more time in bottle i think and will probably merit 4 stars in the long run impressive remeniscent of a top rhone grenache hightoned a touch medicinal this is really good wine intense fruit but a nice balance top this has now opened up nicely gorgeous long mouthfilling greengage fruit it was so tight a few years ago and it has been fascinating to watch its progress it is bone dry and has that wachau sternness that slightly to my surprise i am often a bit ambivalent about this though is drinking so nicely perhaps its just a mistage to try and drink these wines young very top this seems to have become a touch more piquant and hightoned than i recall a grownups wine with tanins that might never be entirely mellow until too late and a classic claret nose lovely top sherberty very open fruit and very pleasantly drinkable at 8 alcohol a bit spritzy at first and ever so slightly hollow on the palate if i was going to criticise on the other hand it has a lovely long finish ready to drink i guess but no great hurry lovely top raspberry fruit nodding at cassis also dry very firm as this producers wines tend to be still a touch hard very nice village wine coming round as it approaches its 10th birthday rather nice intense grapefruity riesling with something towards nectarine on a persistant finish seems quite dry to me for a classicstyle rheingau but that may partly be the particularly good acidity drinking nicely but no hurry to consume might even be better in a few years top a hightoned wine from this most europeanstyled of californian winemakers with rich yet piquant fruit this will improve a bit i suspect but needs the right food bare seven yearold soave the fruit is now rather evolved peach kernels and almonds but still fresh and with a hint of floral notes on the nose some will say this is past its best but i like it a lot dry attractive drinkable a good dry yet with with very nicelytextured fruit a bargain at well the right side of a tenner pleasant nice example without any great extra complexity top red burgundy wine as it helpfully says on the label rather dilute and lacking possibly just too old sweeter fruit than the above and with a simple charm but hard work finding much flavour a bit unripe on the palate and with coarse fruit some pleasant signs of maturity on the nose but not coordinated with the rest of the wine easily the best of the recent pinots that ive had a touch stewed but at least not suffering the dilute characters of the two french wines medium depth well put together for early drinking reasonably taut liquorice and black cherry nose charming for early drinking occasional glimpses of bacon fat and raspberry but some coarseness and awkwardness a slight spritz on opening lihtly honeyed and with hints of blanched almonds sherberty rich drinking very nicely as it has for a while and will for a few years yet long and delicious top rounded forward fruit pleasant but ultimately fairly simple bare rather overwrought huge alcohol rather flabby fruit although superficially theres decent acidity a substantial wine that perhaps i just wasnt in the mood for top gamy rustic highquality fruit interesting quite complex characterful guessed this might be swan top good fruit nicely balanced good concentration good baked tarry fruit very tannic serious perhaps overly so others will admire this more than me jammy solid quite raisiny very substantial wine i find it a touch heavy going at the moment i suspect it will improve and be rather impressive refined concentrated almost hightoned just beginning to drink well lovely nice similar in style but a shade weaker all round good very dark colour very marmaladey ultimately not so complex and clearly upstaged by the filhot light colour but in fact quite botrytised quite hightoned grippy a very good wine for the property very pruney and rich really appealing fruit with some hot edges probably for drinking now and pretty pleasant in its way a bit drier and more mainstream still a shade closed very good bare possibly seems a bit older than it is good acidity and some tannin at the end of a fairly full bodied oldfashioned entrance needs some time to resolve itself more floral and open than the last bottle i had of this well made fizz for drinking young fairly vinous and with good sharply focused acidity at the end a champagne that tastes like a good young fizzy burgundy this needs time and could be stunning possibly not in the best of condition compared with a recent bottle that toby had the flavours are a bit dull and it is more oxiidative than might be expected not rated weighty meaty nose autolytic plus apples similarly with the palate but not at the expense of balance apples again a suggestion of tannins long quite complex perhaps a touch young im sure a year or two in cellar will be beneficial scrapes really quite forward touch of vanilla long and enjoyable but doesnt seem to have the guts to be a real keeper bare only a year or two delayed versus the standard vintage still very fresh nutty and autolytic really yeasty on the nose drier and tighter than the ga 97 too lower dosage probably and perhaps the vintage too complex finish lovely scrapes red wine made from pinot noir of course fairly complex nose bone dry seems a bit flat and old on the midpalate all the interest is on the nose rather dull in the mouth if fizz could be made with these grapes then this is a bit of a waste except that it gives some insight into the nature of fruit that makes good champagne bare very mushroom and truffle and hinting at maderisation curious indeed and not entirely positively old beyond its years is it an odd bottle the guy from bollinger says not but seemed to have decided this before nosing mine perhaps having this after desert was a poor idea i did think of leaving my pud until later and i wouldnt be surprised if there is more to this wine than i found for now the interest on the nose scrapes lovely delicate summer drinking with almond and white fruit flavours lovely delicate summer drinking with almond and white fruit flavours fragrant mellow eminently drinkable fresh but a suspicion of drying at the end suggests this is not for keeping beyond another five or so years hightoned a bit of cranberry a touch of underlying meatiness and excellent fruit lovely but without the vavavoom of the combe aux moins from the same producer and vintage tasted recently still scrapes lively quite complex proper tarry barolo and more or less a point a bit coarsetextured to be worth more than the things one finds when cataloguing the cellar an auction purchase of a couple of bottles i seem to recall i opened one with trepidation but no need actually a healthy light colour and a lovely fresh tar and roses barolo nose the fruit had that underlying sweetness that good barolo has and which with the fragrance sets off the firmness of even mature tannins not terribly complex but really very enjoyable drinking i have oscillated a bit about this 100 gargenega wine it is ca rugates interpretation of what old soave might have been like i seem to recall it has a deep colour from skin contact i think and a broad flat mouthfilling palate after a honeysuckle nose it reminds me a bit of one or two other italian producers who are pushing things in a similar direction massa vecchia and gravner it is rather less grand than either and a bit cheaper but i like it and i think time is making it more interesting intense strawberry nose solid concentrated fruit quite dry as often with lafarge a touch of italianate bitterness and quite firm tannins make it rather a food wine at the moment i hope that rawness wears off i think it will surprisingly hightoned almost amontilladolike nose palate has warm raisiny character and a nice texture very pure raspberry fruit now completely resolved and drinking very nicely i think it lacks the real edge of terroir at this stage or something to add complexity drinking pretty nicely however smoky raspberry fruit begining to show its age a bit but still fresh very drinkable but not superexciting quite fat and mouthfilling i havent drunk this producers wines or chablis from this vintage much so im not sure about the cause of this rather atypical richness still this has a lovely honeyinfluenced palate and enough underlying minerality to be very enjoyable absolutely at peak from a half top i seem to remember having mixed feelings about a bottle of this but this one is lovely completely drinkable medicinallyedged concentrated grenache excellent herbs and spices with rounded greenpea and other vegetal flavours quite individual but really really good another 96 from my cellar opened partly to illuminate the controversy about this vintage healthy colour fine fruit creamy texture and excellent acidity this seems just a touch subdued right now but is definitely very good wine group at mds flowery attractive dry balanced bare larger flatter rich peachy fruit a touch mmore interesting than the perret wine a good peachy rich quite sweet moderate acidity bare very sugary rich sweet not enough acidity for my palate much better balanced pleasant fine teanose lots of acidity leafy rounded balnced very nice bare fragrant gentle a bit gamy pretty good like the beychevelle but a slight twist in the finish fades in the glass a bit a touch highertoned toffeed quite light top reductive at first later fragrant bonedry tarry proper wine top quite dry now delicate peachkernels elegant but perhaps no huge length bare herby brown sugar fairly simple but a nice balance bought from a monastry on majorca 20 yrs ago a pretty pleasant drink fading a bit very evolved a touch hot interesting but a bit disappointing top yeasty nutty complex lovely balance drinking at peak bare very rich and offdry for kabinet a fine vintage i guess a new stylistic experiment supposedly harking back to an ancient style quite dry fantastic length 12 alcohol overall suggestive of austrian riesling interesting very pure and complex oak not very evident an improvement on silex of old excellent concentration excellent very typically raveneau provence herbs creamy lovely top strong nose of apples flat palate possibly the wine is just like this but perhaps this is a substandard bottle not rated gravelly smoky excellent tobacco finish very pleasantly drinkable top dumb nose and rather volatile palate not rated beginning to be rather edgy a bit volatile on the finish not bad a good rubbery rather oxidised rounded berryish touch of raspberry complex substantial very fine oddly empty midpalate hard and difficult finish top fine picquant attractive creamy rich fruit excellent concentration and length nice tone bare soft notable tannins grand but lacks the shapliness of the last wine top rose petals fine nutty elegant top moderate weight fragrant sweet fruit lively excellent mature colour and flavour mineral i thought st emilion and now a touch decadent but a really nice mature claret bare spicy plum fruitcake seems quite merlot but thats probably an illusion lovely minerality all through bare doing well from a halfbottle fragrant now quite balanced some would say a touch past its best but for drining with food im not so sure very pleasant decent st emilion if a bit gummy probably because of oak use healthy colour attractive mature claret nose on the palate it has that slightly hollow hightonedness that seems quite common in the vintage pleasant particularly with food gutsy good fruit very decent effort drinking well lovely for drinking over the next year or three quite advanced but good from a half very bright and mouthwatering pure attractive fruit and some tannic backbone very good not a flashy rowdy 82 but i feel perhaps that in avoiding that the wine lacks the definition or complexity to be better than very good fine wine starting to drink well but a little less than one might hope for given the property and the vintage deep browny slightly green rim caramely burnt quite enjoyable bare deep brown with a green rim riesling nose very madeiralike interesting more than enjoyable in the end very fine balanced starting to drink nicely top rustic quite exotic interesting rather than great top lovely blueberry fruit refined and pure good balance for the vintage smoke and tobacco pleasant palate really nice persistent finish excellent bare rounder fruitier a bit simpler and more rustic time to drink very fine elegant scented balanced still on a gentle upcurve bare sexy perfumed a bit showy very suave lovely easier but less intellectually satisfying than the gpl healthy colour lovely fragrance summery rosehips perfumed lovely from a half good colour chunky quite tannic lacks the easy charm of the issan but pretty good grapefruit kerosene startling acidity over good fruit lovely plummy rich fruit deepening with some air classy drinking still quite tannic bare curiously charred and smoky at first but that blows off presumably not overly toasted barrels then a lovely irony mature claret with succulent fruit emerges delicious drinking fine elegantly balanced and good length refined blanc de blancs could do with a year or so in bottle perhaps but lovely top intense but a bit oaked up at the expense of the clarity that i look for in top soave clearly a good estate and id be interested to try their unoaked top wines a good a bit unexciting decent but didnt do a lot for me fair acidity a touch hollow later on the palate pleasant bare stylish complex nose hints of ozzy vegetality only moderately persistent on the finish quite fine but outrageously overpriced quite rich and sweet the vintage perhaps good quality soft forward quite chocolatey st emilion pleasant drinking being a bit mean excellent fruit some structure serious wine worth another look a really good bottle of one of these recently disgorged wines that canbe a little variable tjis one with lovely autolytic flavours and honey over lovely fresh fruit quite nicely rounded but no hint of flab quite austere and even a touch awkward right now but with lots of character perhaps it will be more easygoing in a year or two but good now with the right food quite forward for maume the vintage perhaps although the attractive ripe fruit is not at the expense of enough backbone for development for a few tears really very nice drinking burgundy i think i have remembered the vintage correctly nice wellmade dessert wine a welcome win for a white burgundy and a good swiss chardonnay as for the zinfandels it confirmed my view that i dont want flashy vibrant stuff i want something with more complexity along the ridge lines good if not dramatic fizz nice acidity honeyed with minor age lovely texture butter and hazelnuts but the age is showing possibly a bit more than is ideal soft and dilute all over the place soft oldish touch of sweetness possibly a bit corked not rated soft and buttery and a touch of banana slight spritz big but balanced fragrant âmodern nose for early drinking clean and fresh big vibrant and zingy but a bit short became toffeed in the glass vibrant and in a dry style needs a bit more time possibly more complexity than the others and to my mind a better style of wine for it smooth rather than vibrant a touch of volatility vegetal and astringent all over the place i think this wine had a synthetic cork poor leafy and some tannin simple and falls apart sweet but a bit lacking in acidity some grip corked not rated opened after the disappointment of the 1999 also seemed poor but this was at the end of the evening so i wont score but there was debate about synthetic corks â not rated from a half not the best example of this showing too much age and sweetness on this showing yeasty quite fragrant slightly toffeed fruit quite decent length some might say tired but i find this rather good not often one has a swiss wine tight sherberty riesling nose the fruit quite forward but the excellent length suggests a good future quite intense oily hazelnuts good length top overcharred wood gutsy palate slight harshness on the finish this does all moderate with time and there is good fruit im not so keen on this bare rather oxidised not rated unforthcoming nose forward pinot fruit quite ripe hightoned cranberryedged fruit very nice a little richer and riper darker and deeper good length another top dry raspberry fruit dry palate not insubstantial stylish terroir wine a bit short but good slightly sweeter mineral riper palate complete wine very good indeed soft fruit slight spritz gets much better white pepper nose silky fruit a bit less characterful less sauvage than last two almost soft some oak influence perhaps just the great vintage but drier and more terroirdriven very very good possibly could do with another year or two lots of botrytis nice balance lovely baked fruits refined bags of ripe fruit sweet yet firmly structured balanced long excellent port from a house that i dont usually pay much attention to slightly corked not rated deep orange colour apricot fruit pleasant but odd an attempt at olfashioned winemaking that doesnt quite come off dry quite closed still hightoned fruit needs time a low deeply meaty round some tannins rather good very pure raspberry fruit savoury good length scrapes quite engaging in its way almost dry appley fragrant and attractive quite fresh and nicely autolytic good balance very drinkable finer more intense and more elegant pretty classy scrapes richer and a bit more structured than the previous wine quite serious needs a few years pure balanced nice food wine easy bone dry pleasant a little light beside the pouilly softer and fruitier on the palate than the gc two patches of vines that are quite close together they are quite different but i wonder if one could or should blend them clean dry but with underlying richness and some minerality good a decent step up to real grand cru quality good length top a bit soft and unfocussed beside the colombier wines but i find it hard to say whether it is producerstyle or the dreaded hot vintage syndrome striking again a good straightforward clean dry decent chablis top confusion marketing i feel this wine sells for a tiny bit more and has quite a lot of added richness id pay the extra every time extravagantly rich and mouthfilling oakinfluenced i need to have a proper drink of this sometime to decide whether it carries it off it quite possibly does in which case full and rich tending towards a fatness which while clearly in balance i sometimes find too much in carillons wines scrapes understated dry none of that fatness the village wine has lots of puligny character good balance and excellent length rounder and more easygoing than the perrieres still good balance and a fine wine but this can happily be drunk now although surely it will improve a touch nicely made meursault nice balance although perhaps with an air of being what it is a very good village wine and without 1er cru distinction bare charcterful gutsy meursuault with a bit of bitterness on the finish that im not sure i like so much perhaps this will depart with a year or two in bottle for now judgement reserved not rated a bit richer and broader with good length very nice a special selection i think and notably more expensive quite serious concentrated fruit and good structure and so you get what you pay for a bit clarety fruit tending toward cassis and some wood influence i think pleasant enough quite large and broad a food wine i think and it will take a few years aging quite well a cortese and chardonnay blend at least a top pleasant forward fruit with a twist of bitterness not bad at all top method champenois from chardonnay and pinot idiosynchratic wine with a touch of pink and some hightoned red wine aromas id like to try some more at least a top nebbiolo barbera blend quite heavily oaked quite good of its sort fragrant elegant fruit lots of underlying tannins fairly modernstyled needs a few years and on the way up but perhaps not beyond a good rounded suave fruit some tannins but would be fine with food top silky burgundian but structured very fine but i sometimes feel sandrones wines are a bit of a trick almost too polished bare a touch larger and richer i think like the la vigne modernstyle but without excessive oak influence nicely poised splendid balance clean and pure sophisticated wine nicely done although to my taste it might be better without the barriques pure very restrained varietal statement a plus point nice top richer 2003 was very warm here too i think similar quality top an exotic blend of chardonnay sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio i think rather nicely constructed a wine that i would like to sit down and try properly i suspect it would repay scrutiny and so lets say lovely texture lovely fruit nice acidity and length very fine top i dont taste a lot of young tokaji this though seems very promising as above but added richness top raspberry and chocolate fruit a lesser vintage that you could almost drink now pretty good aniseed baked fruit very dense i hardly ever drink young port but i am sure this will be very good intense sweet blackberry nose and concentrated palate very much newwave rioja good yes very good in its way interesting less so at least to me higher toned and with very evident tannins but very much in the same style seriously pricey same as a bottle of rioja altas famous 890 give me the latter any day top curious it seems to have oldfashioned touches of volatility but generally a modern style pretty good bare reliable ridge pretty good bare classic quite bordeaux on the nose but with an extra ripeness even more evident on the palate still quite classically styled and very fine at nahm restaurant at the halkin hotel in london very good food by the way with a thai meal touch of residual co2 luscious ripe fruit already showing some maturity so quite forward very lovely pleasant but slightly flattextured bare touch of sulphur evident good gutsy big top dark colour v flat and odd not rated sound clear hightoned quite pulignyish actually rather intense and long good yuk unpleasant nose of a really odd and undescribable sort blows off to a large extent but still not rated slightly sulphury clean palate tight quite long a bit thin at first certainly less than the other meursaults good dry austere long more intense opens up dramatically peaches minerals very nice bare intense very long just what one might hope for top gamy rustic mentholy liquorice hightoned earthy others liked this a bit more but id say just pretty good a bit fizzy wears off hightoned cherry fruit very attractive intense dry balanced earthy structured very nice indeed bonedry nutty nose slightly gluey palate pretty fine but i have reservations about the gluey component could do with a year or two slightly sweeter style dessert rather than aperetif but reasonable acid balance nice grapey fruit apricot jam quite a lot of botrytis modest acidity decent rather than excellent length perfectly nice but a bit simple for a top wine unless it is in a quiet phase a bare very honey and orange peel pretty sweet modest acidity and so a little cloying might come in to better balance in time but im not sure may be just a bit overdone not quite my style but lots of apricot coconut banana and exotic fruit big and rich yet so complex lovely and will be great limey seems lightweight at first but thats probably just following yquem good intensity and length lovely complexity too apples cinnamon and bananas someone said disjointed acidity a gentle but in fact quite persistent finish a touch towards cloying but very good of its type others will like this more all wines drunk at crantock bay hotel overlooking the bay during an enjoyable family holiday an intersting wine list just the sort of things after those long days surfing the atlantic rollers ok bodyboarding on my fouryearolds mickey mouse body board good warm bordeauxblend red from argentina for drinking fairly young simple rather unbalanced shiraz with some vibrancy fresh fruity stuff with a good balancing acidity no great complexity good food wine hearty and with some tannin light syrah fragrance and good balance medium weight for short term drinking i probably always have higher expectations of a wine with the name perrin on it than i should do maybe i should always taste them blind this wine lacks dimension and doesnt really excite peachy spicy rounded very elegant modest acidity for drinking bare richer more mineral slightly better grip unforthcoming at first emerges more mineral than above altogether more substantial a serious longterm wine oxidised not rated pleasantly rich honied intense very good bare exotic rich sweeter than just offdry top cherries highoned chalky minerality very firm and very good perhaps a touch less silkyily fine than more recent fourrier vintages bare soft rounded touch of mint fleshy very nice rounded and ripe soft and delicious slightly more cooked bare a touch lighter than the other two vintages but very fine and nicely wrought creamy apricots very nice if a bit simple bare fairly dry a touch more complex than the sauternes rather fine rosepetals touch of marzipan lots of glycerol creamy very lovely corked not rated strawberries and a touch of yeastiness elegantly balanced clear riesling nose with a touch of sweet toffee thats probably come with the maturity rather charmingly fragrant nose of violets modern chianti for drinking young easy clean burgundy without huge depth but with purity of fruit an intersting comparsion wine to the earlier chianti this is more robust and has a slight bitterness to the fruit holding up well and probalbly needs more time very graceful almondy nose slightly floral but pleasingly free of overt varietal statement i think its a blend of various varieties for what its worth on the palate completely balanced with perfect acidity and a touch of ripe lemon around a concentrated but understated palate very fine seems quite oxidatively made stony meaty rather than elegant pretty nice but not out of this world good colour blackcherry nose fruit quite baked in character and at first it seems to have a hole in the midpalate but that seemed to fill in once the bottle had been open a while chunky and without the complexity to be really classy dense young colour and intense black cherry and coughsweet nose despite the concentration of fruit its very silky on the palate with a background of ripe tannins very luscious seems almost less approachable the next day which is a bit frightening top stuff a long maceration job in the style of gravner but from garganega from gambellara just outside soave deeply coloured but slightly cloudy with a flat peachy nose slight spritz on the fruit interesting but slightly flawed i feel ill keep a look out for further vintages but just a good creamy texture and highttoned herby fruit very dry and quite stylish but perhaps it was better a few years ago it does seem to be drying out a bit top refined mineral richness nice balance all through pretty dry and clean good stuff healthy colour fragrant rosegarden nose with cedar and tobacco notes the fruit quite sweet and ripe this seems resolved but lasts well overnight rather good quite chocolatey fruit seems a touch attenuated at first but opens up to a delicious blueberryraspberry mixture from a half bare apples spices quite exotic rather rich fruit high acidity pinot weightiness on the palate needs a couple of years in bottle attractive silky grenache fruit very drinkable not a property ive drunk much recently and it used to be a bit of a joke for producing englishmans claret theyve done quite well in this vintage though quite powerful and structured good fruit drinkable now but probably more so in a couple of years good at the price lovely vibrant deep pink colour once open for a quarter of an hour a delicious nose of strawberry fruit quite vinous like a substantial still rose rather than champagne with a touch of colour long finish will probably benefit from a year or two in bottle top lead pencil nose a fair amount of new oak i suspect fairly lightweight and elegant perhaps to excess not like jasmin of old bare suspiciously deep colour really a bit overly oxidative but underneath theres nice honied fruit bare pure pleasant top nice fruit fruitcake good structure could do with a year or two decent balance vanilla weight of a traditional wine but the fruit quite bright and fresh cherry pleasant worth talento is apparantly a trademark of a consortium of growers in northern italy making methode champenoise fizz from mainly champagne grapes this is made by prosecco producer bisol it has the charcteristic yeasty character fine fruit its dry but not overaustere nice it might make an interesting ringer in a flight of growers champagnes moderate weight quite burgundian quality fairly hightoned very good drinking top piercing tar and roses nose still a touch hard on the palate bone dry with quite a lot of tannin drinkable but will improve a bit i think bare grassy slightly flabby fruit softly grassy fruity floury meunier i guess flowers white bread pleasant finish good slightly sicky edge to the fruit rather dominated by red wine characters im not so keen rather soft easy fruit both nose and palate quite rich briochey to drink quite soon but good bare red fruits frothy quite weighty good strawberry finish top a blend of 95 and 96 creamy gamy rich stewed apples and strawberries again rather good perhaps even reserved pure stony mineral strawberries again mediumweight and excellent length very nice quite creamy mineral persistent a good gingery fruit pleasant but a bit dull now more evolved rich lowacid mature rhone rich deepcoloured rather newoak influenced seems oxidative in danger of being overwrought not clear where this is going has some character though again deepcoloured ambitious not that exciting to drink now but it might improve creamy minerals delicious very elegant moderate weight quite complex and an excellent finish for the vintage chestnut coffee lovely ripe fruit quite fresh and fruity still wellstructured but drinking well no hurry to drink this a little difficult at first then rounded christmascake fruit less exotic than the 85 and more 1dimensional top two halves the better nicely balanced biscuity digestible top rather lovely fresh hightoned dry and savoury top baked fruits balanced 125 a creamy the finish suggests it needs drinking over the next few years bags of botrytis but a bit coarse a sample sent by the winery fresh strawberry and redcurrant flavours with good balancing acidity and a touch of eldeflower good easy drinking for a summers evening frizzante only 65 alcohol pleasantly refreshing rather like a moscato but floral rather than grapey it says dolce on the corner of the label its about demisec and nicely in balance of rthe style ideal for sunny garden evenings well made rather good fruit oak fairly evident on the palate but probably not excessive although i must say i like less and less oak in my wines quite mineral too could do with a bit longer in bottle but probably wont make four stars as it seems just a bit simple by the highest standards its sad but waitrose is much better than any previous source of fruit and veg in the city toffee and caramel quite maderised and a bit vegetal but maintaining interest and drinkability despite being past its best i oscillate between finding this too fargone and admiring it a reminder of what overold white burgundy should be like as compared to the current rash of prematurely oxidised wines that are simply rotting some will find this unappetising but ill settle on lively hightoned more suggestive of puligny than chassagne good acidity and quite mineral very nice what i hoped rather more 96s would be like bready elegant moderate weight perhaps down to age lemony long rich finish a top softly peachy fruit easy stuff nicely made top touch drier richer more serious but still fairly easy good a bit more depth and allround strength with some positive evolution ahead not really longterm though fragrant dry long very attractive rather rubbery this bottle somewhat oxidised good underneath i think not rated dry and perfumed gamy end a star more or less drinking now lovely biscuity nose balanced fruit complex long and lovely fantastic concentration thoroughly integrated after a fascinating nose a great wine if not terribly coterotie beginning to hint at volatility so time to drink i feel piquant tending towards edgyness still rather good mature wine top quite dry barleysugar fruit intense lots of fruit almost obscuring lots of botrytis rich and very good quite liquoricey sweet spirit a bit disjoint currently raisiny fruit extravagantly sweet ripe nice but suspect balance to me currently it might well improve the friends very kindly came with two bottles of champagne one a backup bottle in case the main one wasnt showing well possibly just past its peak but a nice wine for those who like their champagne old which i do ok 1990 isnt that old but this isnt the greatest name in champagne either good slightly oxidised maturity with the 1990s softness evident this bottle has been shouting drink me drink me for the last couple of years eyeing me up each time i opened the cellar i had it last in 1999 when it was disappointing this time though it was a glorious claret with warm pencilshaving nose and palate im glad ive resited its calling until now because this bottle was caught at its best there is a touch of weediness well its not the best vintage ever but the balance is fine this is the sort of wine that makes keeping fine wine so satisfying i could drink a lot of this alas though this was my last bottle a charming a coarser wine than the pichon above with higher toned acidity and a more granular structure good pleasant wine that held its own a good solid from a half marmalade nose and a waxy lanolin palate a bit simple possibly but showing rather nicely i cant usually get too excited about sancerre but this is rather enjoyable it has enough age to have lost its initial zing but still has a pleasing balance of fruit acid and honeyed grassy flavours this is syrah garnacha and tempranillo in the ratio 721 modern wine but well made with a dryness of fruit balanced by good tannins a bit closed at present i feel but it probably has some potential a cautious rich and satisfying yet balanced has benefited from a bit of cellaring an underrated house a good wax lanolin quite dry grass and corn very very long really lovely a little lighter at first but very similar in character to the haut brion tasted with it long again fills out nicely once it has been open a while excellent fragrant fruity nose liquorice mineral palate really interesting wine lovely dry savoury palate sucks from your tongue after a ripe start classic mature claret and really good open fruity nose lovely irony palate scrapes quiet nose totally individual irony dry complex long palate a great pleasure stylish hightoned integrated botrytis a really good wine from a property that doesnt always do it for me lightweight dilutish wine but clean and otherwise balanced drinking nicely with hints of chocolate and an overarching dryness a good a touch of rusticity in the background behind some good sweet fruit simple grassy very dry elegant touch of autolysis lovely balance peachy offdry nice balance fairly low acid a lesser vintage but it might well age nicely touch of kerosene very textured quite intense and long the richness is down to a a touch of botrytis apparently bare amazingly long mineral too dry complex drinking well but completely fresh gorgeous scrapes bonedry nice range of flavours very good basic burgundy broader slightly flatter quite rich rather impressive decent a touch of toffee quite complex very minty odd but interesting very mineral too which seems a good sign theres an element of benefit of the doubt in going for a bare very fresh and clean sophisticated chassagne from a vineyard i hadnt really heard of nicely poised top mainstream quite beetrooty fairly rich very nice a basic rustic edge dry finish not totally sucessful in a difficult vintage gamy exotic a touch rustic slightly dry and edgy from the oak perhaps it will soften but i worry its been pushed a bit hard bare rich full impressive carries the oak rather more easily still a bit hard at the end better drinking the quality of the vineyard means the fruit has the density to carry the oak top brown sugar quite restrained very fine and long top fragrant easylight salty and appetizing a bit too easy to be great perhaps top rounded quite ripe meaty and tending to decadence hightoned very nice if not wildly complex ry dl and ja came to a small midweek dinner notes are from memory i was feeling too lazy to write anything down elegant lacks a bit of weight and grip perhaps mostly the vintage i guess fine wine but lacking any very special buzz top smoky refined holding nicely although for drinking in the next year or two rather lovely top reminder to self i must stop thinking of eighties clarets as infants this is pretty much mature although it will probably evolve interestingly over a decade or more very classic cigarbox and cassis a pleasure to drink top exotic or perhaps i just dont drink enough brunello fresh herby redolent in a curious way of icecream very attractive top coming towards maturity great breeding fine balance in quite a weighty wine all the classic barsac characteristics greenrimmed quite fresh elegant nose perhaps lacking the weight and complexity of the best colheitas but a rather good drink slips down very easily the bottle is empty today top a bit disappointing too easy to drink that may sound odd but i want my chablis with some green acidity and this wine is too soft and lacking structure having said that its not bad i suppose a grudging easy peachy fruit pleasantly fruity fragrant in an oily sort of way a touch flabby fading rieslingy nice weight bare a bit flatter and a touch dull ok but only dry good concentration nice balance top quality in a restrained style mineral good length lovely too lifted cherry cough sweet pleasant wine similar quite concentrated bigger and riper bare quite suave serious a touch of vanilla modernstyle fut de chene proudly advertised never a good sign a bit hollower corked not rated stylish mature wine fades in the glass though bare a bit rougher but interesting mature rustic wine reasonable enough bare very pale thin on the palate a curiosity technically french but made in the southern hemisphere no stars middle weight a bit colourless xmas cakey muscatel grapes citric quite sweet but balanced nice drier nicely poised slightly hot bitter finish bare orange peel grapes and cofee beans smoky interesting a good almost a maderised feel to it with honeyed apples and a slight woodiness on the nose good stuff opened with trepidation given tobys recent article ablout 1996 white burgundy this one however was fine elegant light to medium bodied and with good use of oak good texture to the wine possibly needs more time in bottle to be at its absolute best i dont know whether to score this wine or not when first opened there was an immediate whiff of corkiness however returning to the wine later in the evening no corkiness was present but it did seem a bit flabby and with an oxidised edge i am now drinking the rest of the bottle as i type again when i first took the cork out a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night a corky edge lurked within the wine but it disappeared as had the oxidised edge the wine i am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold see the note for pichon 92 below but this wine seems to be living in reverse if i left it another few days id probably end up with a bunch of grapes quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when i poured the last glass from the bottle scored as it is now drinking top beginning to tire fruit oxidising drinkable but not for too much longer a joy not a wine that needs too much thinking about but delivers what is expected of a decent twentyyearold pauillac elegance and grace and with the clarety minerality of age at peak i think but no rush to drink up i have quite a lot of this wine and i have been a bit concerned of more recent times whether i needed to rush to drink it up on this bottles showing i need not have too many worries about that not quite up to the standard of the previous wine it somehow lacks the breeding but good nonetheless with fruit and maturity working well together no rush to drink up a bottle opened the night before which ljm brought round on the off chance alas not really fair to judge this wine in such condition so i wont score not rated from a half dark tarry amber colour lovely black treacle nose theme of alsace white preferably on the vt side of richness and spanish reds from anywhere but obviously from spain oh and a fizz to start with inferior italian fizz soft from a twothird sweet and muscaty soft not a style i enjoy i thought this was riesling some sweetnes and richness with a touch of steel not as long as it might be corked not rated very thin compared with the other wines of the evening my fault for bringing it good but not showing as well as it should liquorice and mineral i liked it others didnt from a half vegetal coarse varnishy astringent finish odd sweet botrytisy nose lovely balance delicious a top good colour a touch green on the palate decent slightly metallic some age not much going on young coloured subdued nose oak and good closed tannins smokey tempranillo delicious pick of the reds for me young and deep and with sweetness tannins but a bit volatile more age than others a touch tarry not quite together but ok from a half i think tasted at the end of the evening cant remember much about it and i didnt make notes but i seem to have scribbled down good textured wine with slightly bitter tannins black cherry fruit mineral dry fairly austere quite flavoury very nice top quite forward eminently approachable already authentic burgundy fruit decent acidity and a sophisticated creaminess to the texture all very good it seemed to lack a measure of intensity particularly late on the palate it seems to fail to be either properly intellectual or properly hedonistic a good wine for drinking over the next couple of years top genuine chalky minerality and once it has opened up rich but not excessively so nectarinekernel fruit nice acidity and good length starting to drink quite well now but no hurry to consume easy clean mineral pure and delicious its a good trick combining tautness and minerality with creamytextured fruit delicious and nosign of the problems thatplague the vintage bare rich and full fairly advanced as the wines from this producer often are but no sign of the premature oxidation tha plagues the vintage theres a bitter edge to the fruit that stops me giving the highest rating its a funny thing bitterness sometimes it seems an asset to a wine sometimes a problem im not so keen on its manifestation in this wine still a top rich quite fat slightly offdry forward perhaps the vintage and nicely mouthfilling a good hightoned dry floral mineral richer keroseney slightly offdry this vintage was quite warm in nz too balanced long forward fat quite evolved dry and balanced but the fruit doesnt quite have the tone a good ungainly now hard fantastic underlying concentration comlexity and length will be excellent dry but rich complex still a bit hard fantastic complexity resolved i guess but nowehere close to decline a delight and like the previous two wines quite firm and masculine hightoned so juicy lovely structured riper and bigger complex and delicious a bit easygoing to be really great bare shoepolish showing its age a bit no more than slightly off in some hardtoplace way not rated lovely completely fresh complex and long easy pale but green rim loads of brown sugar fantastic fruit a lovely dessert wine hightoned nose hinting at aniseed quite sweet lighttomedium weight palate very fragrant and elegant others found things they were less keen on in this wine but for me a top tropically edged greenpea fruit manages to be quite easily fruity but pretty dry and appetising good intensity and length very pure and enjoyable lightcoloured fragrant pinotlike really fairly simple but pleasant makes intense brambly fruit quite forward easygoing more or less drinking now dark and dense wood still a bit evident on a concentrated background as it opens up it is just simply very good the fruit seems very mature almost over herby quite complex still quite tannic as paolo de marchi remarked there can be a problem with sangiovese of the fruit maturing before the tannins bare quite mineral as cabernet goes rounded easy very drinkable but without the edge of the ceparello a bit highertoned perhaps more tannins but generally a little bit thinner still nicely elegant quite sweet fairly sherried and very intense lovely concentration one of those wines that is just bordering on the past it but is still pleasant and intersting to drink its possibly just that bit too oxidised but this has given it a nutty character rather disjointed and disappointing a bit volatile it might come together but i think not not something to get too excited about but with decent sweet strawberrycherry fruit undrinkable past it musty vinegar not rated elegant fine fruity long long finish mahogany dry oozing age complex quite challenging and altogether wonderful elegant savoury rather good really nice just a hint of sweetness chocolate fruit top gamy rustic straw nose nice fruit idiosyncratic but nice lovely top lightmedium weight elegant hightoned strawberry perfumed dry very good decent much more dense cassis fruit a very substantial wine but nice balance maybe even taught dry and structured fragrant too hightoned complex good tending towards leafy hightoned hints of tobacco very mineral and stylish slightly softer riper and rounder still nicely structured probably a better allround wine than the 2000 pure dry rich elegant top more spicy white pepper complex long more mineral spicy delicious top a bit enigmatic intense concentrated this may be beginning to emerge sage and onion stuffing cranberries strange but splendid light fragile colour sweet dilutish strawberry colour pleasant enough well put together tight wine bright and vibrant good fruit nice balance probably only for short term aging a good white bread leaps about of the bottle on opening nutty dry green apples the fruit changes every time you come back to it a prestige cuvee that lives up the billing lovely drinking easy could do with another year or so to mellow but this is nicely structured fizz with floral aromas and refined appley pinot fruit its a bdn i believe with overtones of white chocolate pleasingly dry top a blend of grapes from 8990 and 91 cuvee 5 disgorged march 04 fresh bread and apple nose rich full yeasty and meaty palate perhaps in danger of being a bit coarse without food as blanc de noirs sometimes are possibly a little more time in bottle will help complex and with a long honied finish this opens up with a little breathing and is really rather good top honey yeast apples a complex nose and palate that repays attention this still seems a bit tightly wound as yet my impression is that while very good theres no extra depth of character apparent from its single vineyard status a prestige cuvee ill try again but i wont be rushing bare unpleasantly oxidised i hope this is an odd bottle not rated a half opened rather soon after shipping seemed confected and estery at first quite citric but with decent concentration i think this is better than it initially seems lets say it is scraping white bread and currants on the nose light to medium weight elegant fruit quite a lot of meunier which shows slightly negatively on the palate very good but could one ask for slightly more intensity without sacrificing the elegance im not sure im being critical but this is very nice 2001 plus reserve wines disgorged june 2004 i like the informative backlabel very top rich nose chocolate yeast dense fruit quite a weighty vinous palate perhaps a bit heavy at the moment and perhaps rather woodinfluenced but this might mellow with a year or two in bottle into something very fine might even rate another star in its way but for now touch of white bread but mainly ripe granny smith apples on the nose pretty decent basic nv bare perfectly pleasant but a bit nondescript this has aged ok without really developing in an interesting way this is rather dominated by farmyard straw on the nose an palate too rustic for me in a way that i dont think will improve with age ok but no more than that bare 100 oldvine pinot meunier and thus interesting floral and perhaps floury or am i being influenced by the name of the grape fruit quite forward in the mouth and a bit colourless on the midpalate with an ordinary finish real champagne balance quite dry makes it pretty drinkable however although it is hard to find much real complexity an oddity that is worth trying particularly if one wants to get a grip on the grape and what it might contribute to wines like moet nv for instance scrapes quite autolytic appley fruit complex an honied quite dry and with good pinot gutsiness all this after seeming a bit maderised at first but as often with champagne this seemed to blow off excellent citric appley nose with yeasty notes quite complex ripe rounded fruit despite the excellent acidity of the vintage needs a bit more time though aspects of it seem quite tightly wound still quite long too and creamy textured light to medium weight elegant complex and nutty quite long just occasionally it seems a little oilykeroseney on the palate but that may be the food i am having with it really pretty good although probably for drinking over the next couple of years a good deal from oddbins at not muchover £20 bare a bit coarse on first sip but this seems less noticable afterwards the fruit quality is a way short of champagne so a fairly basic wine pleasnat enough one of those evenings with a lot of corked and oxidised bottles even before i arrived there had been some bad whites last taste from a nearly exhhuasted bottle i arrived late seemed typically lovely gamy succulent tannins lovely slightly corky not rated completely shot oxidised not rated gamy warm berries very pleasant typical mature beaucastel of this period substantial but rather oxidised not rated to make up for the corked rhones touch of game lovely ripe fruit quite low acid lovely chocolate cherries strawberries easy rich yet appealing lovely complex palate really really top port complete wine really pretty good but so upstaged by the niepoort bare mainly from my own cellar tasted in the last month or two quite mineral but this seems a bit flabbier flatter and lacking freshness than i remember i could worry that we have a touch of prematureoxidation disease here although the wine is perfectly drinkable i hope its an odd bottle the one i had in july 2004 was fine and ive had a couple since which i did not note because they were similar nice fruit very drinkable quite luscious even with a richness that one might attribute to the standing of the vineyard good balance too but nice though it is i find it rather undemanding no tautness no succulence in short no really grownup qualities id hope for more excitment from this vineyard still a fine drink and it doesnt sell for huge money either a bottle drunk over two evenings as opposed to my last notr from the middle of a wine dinner bright and attractive raspberry cranberry and beetroot pinot a touch of oak and tannins but fundamentally in an easy drinking style very pleasant drinking but not profound will improve a touch over a shortish timescale but not a longterm wine very excessively even citric good acidity and a modest finish no sign of 96 oxidation i was given this knowing only that it was a 96 white burgundy thought it might be a disappointing grander wine actually this is rather good for its level top on first opening bright hightoned delciously fruity mainly red fruits and with good balance and length very quaffable later some minerality appears too and it seems stylish too very nice indeed probably for drinking over the next few years a very top even with decanting still quite hard and needing food stylish i hope it will resolve well a bit reductive at first opens out to reveal strong hightoned fruit and a bit of pinot animality a touch hard at the moment particularly without food but pretty good top splendidly mineral and delicious bare one bottle rather orange an unpalatable oxidized burgundy syndrome i fear another quite mature and hinting at the same but still rather good and pleasantly drinkable the good one fresh strawberry fruit moderate acidity some tannins and still quite firm although the acidity is moderate opens out nicely overnight but still has a twist of bitterness at the end of the palate that i have mixed feelings about bare bonedry austere at first but then just very classic appetising white burgundy at peak bare the champagne was the last wine of the dinner and very good it was too very elegant specially considering this is blanc de noirs dry yet very appetizing bare quite fine creamy but a little sweet lacks minerality and steelyness dumb or not quite right could even be the early stages of premature oxidation not rated tight dry meursault nuttyness lovely acid touch of lemon very fine very fine balanced complex intense very long still improving gamy nice ruit earthy nice but not so long very pleasant mature wine ravishingly gorgeous elegant fragrant fruit very lovely if a little light and perhaps no more than it ought to be for a grand cru some want to keep this for 10 years and probably good it will be in rather a different way but i love it now too lovely mushroomy nose perfectly fresh nicely dry ripe but with excellent acidity and good length creamy and mineral excellent very mineral stony and dry lemony intense very raveneau starting to drink well delicate fragrant almost floral mediumweight palate succulent tannins gives some bite on the finish bare very evolved colour open nose rich hinting at corruption slightly open palate that puts me off but classy irony hints are rather lovely bare a bit grassy and cloying on the finish i enjoyed this at the square in london a while ago but it seems a bit dull this time bright clean nice pure fruit nice acidity mouthwatering scrapes one bottle a bit cooked and plummy another brighter and fresher with good density of fruit not i suppose the finest or most complex fruit but nice the better one a bare quite rustic lightbodied but quite intense characterful top quite leesy and rich chassagnelike a touch showy perhaps top nice tone appetising friends brought this round for lunch lovely medium weight burgundy with touches of toffee nuts and melon good to have a wine that doesnt seem sterile in its freshness and isnt trying to be any more than it should be and heres the coincidence i just happened to drag this out of the racks in preparation for the same lunch this as one would expect has more signs of age theres also a slight dirtinessstalkiness to the wine again none of that sterility that can make some modern wine so boring good maturing burgundy this wine has been a bit of an enigma over the years toby and i have both given varying reports this bottle however was exactly what it should be fresh and vibrant sweet strawberry and beetroot and with good acidity more than pleasant bright and hightoned good nice fruit concentration good acidity bare added complexity fine length restrained gives the impression of being a bit less complex or is it just a bit closed bare the nightmare vintage this is quite restrained to the point that i worry a bit about its weight its retained some good puligny character though bare pure pinot simple but nicely balanced bare richer and more complex again richer and nicely textured quite dry with a touch of minerality approaching youngish vines but good definition with bright fruit bare elegant wellbred pretty good top meaty substantial vinous fairly soft a bit short on elegance perhaps a good frothy fine mousse sweet fruit quite exotic rich very much a food wine scrapes fat tokay nose rich sweet palate pretty good needs time a bare botrytis fairly rich barleysugar tends to shortness and quite sweet quite evolved green and gold too top christmas cake underbrush touch of smoke quite rounded fruit pretty elegant smokier tea nose fragrant moderate weight quite easygoing fruit very tannic finish tobaccoleaf elegant but just slightly roughwoody too is it absolutely and completely right pleasant mature claret a little nondescript perhaps maybe not a great bottle of this smoky cigary classic later spring flowers perfect balance lovely leesy rounded touch of nuttyness very fine rich easygoing pure effortlessly fresh elegant and lovely bare rounded earthy really quite splendid with years to go a fine the 05s all barrel samples and so notes not to be taken that seriously pineappley oak from this new barrel yeasty rich and rounded fruit hazelnut fruit quite tight and with good length the acidity seemed moderate top back to round chassagne richness mouthfilling and potentially very drinkable tighter than the romanee excellent chassane again exotic complex yet welldefined lovely long finish lemony fruit clearly classy but a touch insubstantial perhaps because this is quite young vines bare hazelnuts quite etheriel with a lovely underlying richness splendid quite closed currently stony and dry good length bare more floral than the caillerets excellent length bare rounded forward fruit but with a steely core not evident in the other chassagnes very good a touch of ginger on the nose lots of class but pretty moderate weight again one could imagine this filling out though jumps out of the glass mixed tropical fruit and some veg rather exotic and not my sort of thing very early drinking bare quite fat but much more in balance than the caillerets with a floral touch good ripe and plummy beetrooty quite rich highertoned crunchy red fruits potentially rather good a synthesis of the last two nice balance and quality fruit elegant plumns and red fruits rather good perfumed more feminine than the chaumes but still wellstructured a touch of beetroot too top plummy baked fruit character the berries were small and shrivelled bare the 2005s all barrel samples i have not made notes at all on some of the whites because they had all just been subjected to battonage i have added a note and score to those that seemed more assessable lees just stirred not rated lees just stirred not rated easier to see through the effects of recent battonage on this wine particularly apples nuts good richness at least forward fruity characterful top richer probably will be very good pure dry penetrating very classic maybe even lees just stirred not rated lees just stirred but suggests a strong effort not rated pure and bright nice fruit but rather tannic good lovely pure fruit very fine i do hope it doesnt get too much oak but i fear it will dominate the wine top tannic again but a nice purity of fruit concentrated rich and tannic not at a good stage for tasting seems promising not rated forward fruity nicely made quieter less flamboyant than the auxey attractive fragrant lifted fruit very nice but the oak a bit intrusive on the finish softtextured and ripe the vintage i guess rich fruit bare the star ratings below should be regarded as very approximate since the wines are a way from finished and i do not do a lot of tasting from cask see the accompanying article for some discussion in short though all the reds are very highly recommendable pure dry quite tannic quite mineral leesy now fine frangrant and elegant flamboyant outgoing splendid stony cherries really nice fruit strong iron dry and reserved with quite lightbodied fruit more rounded fruity and earthy intense round cherry fruit and a touch of farmyard mineral lightbodied dry and intriguing earthy spicy dry quite reserved richly gamy quite striking flattering now but it could also become a touch tiring compared for example to the graceful champaux both rich and elegant it seems to combine the best of all the other gevreys lovely reserved compared to the st jacques elegant and intense with a very long finish very impressive nice nose pure and unforced fine dry palate a good example the 2005s below were barrel samples of as yet unfinished wines bright red fruits pure and appetising very fine for the classification top red fruits very chambolle good concebtration and complexity for village wine orchard fruits and plums quite easygoing top highertoned cherries quite dry bright and elegant very good indeed charming strawberry fruit nice weight in the mouth lovely mineral hightoned savoury and appetising not unlike the fuees but a little less striking at this stage a bit animal but still pure and precise expressive of terroir too top pretty feeble effort this could be fizzy anything it has no character pleasantish white with a good texture and peachy fruit im feeling generous dull none of the depth freshness of fruit or vibrancy i was expecting tangy yeasty quite concentrated not especially fine or long sherberty lemony extravagantly rich touch of liquorice has a certain appeal but its out of balance to me bare toffee spicey very thin on nose and palate may be a poor bottle not rated a bit light but reasonable flavour and balance bare very cassis nose minty very primary very ripe structured under quite open fruit rich lifted cherry fruit touch of oak etc cherry again dry tannins might come good lighter weight a bit more oldfashioned touch of volatility on the finish good underlying intensity bare laid back suave ripe but balanced pretty nice reductiveness blows off dry quite flavoury pleasant fresh seems rather older than its years absolutely horrible at first fetid suggestin oxidation cleans up so much in the glass good nose slightly dull palate might be even better after a few hours in decanter top drying out badly bright and pure dry meaty long nice intensity top baked tarry oldfashioned still quite tannic the sort of wine one needs to decant well in advance and to drink a glass or two over a couple of hours at least nice fruit quite tannic solid old barolo top very graceful round ripe fruit lovely pleasant old thing without being special top quite botrytised elegant lighter weight but nice intensity darker larger burnt marmalade very rieussec perhaps needs time a bit dry light hard a bit low on fruit a touch spirity but quite intense lovely classic bordeaux nose bright fruit but a very odd harsh latepalate and a slightly hot finish that leaves bitterness in the mouth would be lovely except for that very nice mineral classic claret lovely balance right through for drinking top medium weight with a lovely savoury palate and a touch not unpleasant now they are resolved of the vintages tannins i like this a lot probably has more time left than the 81 bare very nicely classic cigar box and sweet ripe fruit nose follows through nicely with a hightoned palate bare a bit faded but alive and quite pleasant splendid effort for the vintage very drinkable from a half top intriguing brownsugar nose with lots of mineral terroir notes very classic and savoury gorgeous returning to it walnut nose and the palate too is like licking one hightoned again really splendid but still needs time classic quite austrere and high toned very 66 good length too but it seems just very slightly corked clearly excellent but ill not rate it not rated stunning mix of flavours quite fascinating hints at an edgy volatility too delicious but needs drinking it may be a bit unstable top perfectly balanced mature claret so mineral an absolute pleasure from beginning to end stands out above the last two wines with an amazing extra depth and huge complexity suave yet dry very very long no hurry to drink very ripe and rounded silky rich texture and a long complex palate relatively forward i can see how this got its rave reviews from parker but on returning there are piquant notes too top corked not rated hopelessly oxidised surely an odd bottle not rated much more classic than the 90 dry flavoury with marked tannins my impression is that while very good this wont become a star like the 70 or 61 it seems a touch lighter exotic coconut nose creamy not claret as we know it but fascinating theres great depth and structure and so this probably will be stunning in a while bare young wine cassis but montrose minerality too fairly ripe it seems in a slightly softer more modern style than the later wines in this flight good though liquid minerals and excellent fruit very good and will be lovely very dense a cross between 98 and 90 qute a monster but perhaps some of the older wines were that way in their youth still this will surely be lovely in ten years mineral again but a bit more restrained and classic less exotic than the 96 i like it a lot almost more than the 96 very stylish and balanced a blend of 91 90 and 89 apple and mushroom nose and palate very meaty and substantial big finish two bottles quite different one very honied and becoming a bit austere one fresher with nice richness both quite good pleasant old thing it may be the end of a long night but it seems just to be fading a touch nutty honied touch of herbs quite elusive occasionally has a certain flatness rather attractive very reductive but after a while in the glass fragrant sousbois nutty real tar and roses reveals more each time ypon come back to it bare very pleasantly fruity although a touch of oxidation too some bottle variation drink up good fresh mainstream old barolo tar and roses again very nice mushrooms underbrush pure fruit still quite primary of course dry and savoury an ancientlooking bottle appetising nutty good length pleasing fruity background very nice bare petrolly almost rich fruit quite burgundian probably ageworthy a good ripe fruity rather simple quite new worldy quite characterful mothbally fruit i like it in a way more than the planeta but it hasnt the class of the isole wine top inky tannic youthful not that concentrated touch of mint inky colour tannic quite silky fruit classy top blackcurranty minty silky perfectly nice but no real class baked fruit quite reasonable given that but not really special lighter but more digestible pure transparent wine nicely drinkable bare very deep young red timeless in the sense that it is keeping well but not really developing smoky ultimately not so complex pleasant but a bit faded and disjointed bare label mainly gone clearly old slightly sweet and a bit nutty a bit stinky and faded there might be better bottles top no stars yeasty fruity very nice top before the event while waiting for a taxi at dls deep colour marmalade brown sugar very attractive dry enough at this time in its life to be a plausible aperitif top not so deep a colour but very bright slightly leesy nose with very floral hightoned fruit in the mouth nice tannins lovely acidity and great length very classy bare broader more open on the nose easier going lovely but not quite as mineral as the intistieti bare fantastic nose a mix of floral scents and hightoned fruit explodes in the mouth deeper colour open ravishing nose creamy again pure but open rather than hightoned mature i think bare a slight prickle at first dissipates but perhaps takes the edge off a lovely balanced mature wine bare quite fine touch caramelly perhaps but good old sherry lovely oloroso like texture clearly been in bottle for decades good even more luscious ethereal nutty long fascinating even more so given the the lack of clarity about what it is clean dry a bit leafy modern styled could be anything very nice less characterful than tondonia and this seems only to be a crianza still very drinkable top creamy citric long lovely fine texture needs a year or two lovely bare rich wine gums very tannic and structured rather bitter currently rather extracted new oak coughsweets concentrated extracted tiring not unlike the previous wine but less overwrought fine good rather vaish nice underlying fruit austere dumb dry woody overwrought a bit difficult bare woody again extracted big tea nose cedary fruitcake sweet palate quite leafy cab slightly chunky cos style but very good spice and marmalade intense stands up to french examples very well very good indeed of its type lovely hints at old sherry and madeira fantastically elegant and fine from appearance to finish stunning floral suggestions of warm hay light refreshing noticably offdry a single vineyard wine floral richer and better delineated than the basic wine very drinkable a special selection from various vineyards dumb on the nose with some yeasty notes very much demisec but nicely balanced with a rich palate cartizze is meant to be the very best area demisec again with a refined complex nose and the sweetness seems in balance quite long top still prosecco it does seem rather featureless a passito wine made from prosecco grapes and bottled from a solera established in 1991 this example bottled in 2003 banana nose elegant attractive palate very nice at least the usual zoo bottles everywhere great fun the notes are consequently quite brief and impressionistic nice nose but rather offdry on the palate spoils a nice wine bare a domaine in quintaine macon charming and easy in the best sort of way a great advert for basic burgundy delightful time to drink this i think intense sherberty rather closed needs time at least alive fishymetallic old burgundy touch of 83 tannins could be better i suppose given the terroir others werent so keen but for me a top hightoned bright delicious grenache ripe luscious nice vintage i suppose some complaints that it was light and burgundian but i thought it just proper grenachey chateauneuf pleasant but fading just a bit very fine indeed pure structured intense but unforced has the makings of a classic la chapelle pure and elegant but very gutless and lacking complexity disappointing a sign that jaboulet is losing it kerosene intense ok but not huge acidity very nice not the best bottle woody taint still fine id give this three stars but i know its an even better wine not rated icecream lovely dry piquant palate intense quite tannic perhaps luxury pudding wine fresh disgorged 2003 i believe complex and lovely though i wonder if it would be better brut a taste of how champagne was a century ago top pleasant old thing without being particularly striking like all the gravner whites a deep golden colour quite unlike most modern white wines jammy nectarine nose rather redwinelike grapey peach palate long and honied striking and interesting it has the structure some tannins and balance to improve lovely a little diffuse on the nose by comparison theres some extra complexity from the odd mix of grapes involved but i feel that is superficial and i prefer the honied purity of the ribolla excellent again honied nectarine again excellent but lacking the depth of the 1999 also perhaps a touch flatter still exciting bare interesting fine flavours again a lot less weighty than the 1999 perhaps scrapes in at at first very closed on nose and palate apples and pears emerge with time on the former and honey on the latter rather higher acidity very strong i think this will turn out well a good a touch closed again on the nose and quite tannic on the palate again i guess this will open up beautifully hightoned cherry fruit right through the palate charming nice tannins decent acidity very good ripe very pure cherrylike again pretty exciting wine needing a few years yet top fresh complex lovely balance this does not seem heavily extracted with its graceful elegance very fine top i dont seem to have tasted so much this year and the notes are hurried too much good conversation vinous nose floral and rich fruit i good length but it does seem very woodinfluenced no dosage i believe but it seems wellbalanced a solera wine i gather yeasty rather good i must try a bottle properly one day top tangy salty lovely old wine top very fine and elegant with good intensity and length unless it fills out it seems a little light on the midpalate perhaps i am underrating this for now a top very elegant and fine everything one could hope for from a second wine about time to drink medium weight and nicely resolved pleasant drinking bare a big rounded fruity mouthful quite tannic and a touch awkward now as this vintage often seems to be needs a bit of time still fantastic texture and density really good so suave difficult nose at first but opens out showing silkytextured fruit with a lovely unforced concentration should try a bottle properly at some point for now at least sa portugese oddity piquant hightoned rather interesting lovely mouthwatering and delicious scrapes seems rather evolved at first takes time to open up when it does it has amazing intensity and length the flavours centre around mushrooms and slowmoving rivers lovely dry intense long benchmark wine i feel fragrant dry a midpalate hole but with time in the glass lovely classic old mosel sweety in pretty good condition a good dry keroseney long pretty much dry in the trimbach style excellent ravishing fragrant nose middleweight balanced long lovely a top more sauvage with bright fruit still quite tannic could do with a couple of year it wont be quite as graceful as the chave but its very very good porty needs time dry and flavoursome top very fine dry ripe but not overblown classic cabernet cedaryness too top nice rich grassy good fine elegant possibly a touch spirity very classy but it perhaps needs to be studied carefully on a fairly clean palate still i think a bit sulphury sauvignon dominated like an oaked nz wine bananalike fruit bare much richer and bettertextured rounded moderate acidity quite impressive very immediate hit of warmclimatelike cab easygoing fine for a bbq no great finish bare ripe nose touch of tobacco soft yet not overstated tannins and oak evident on the finish not the sort of wine i personally want to buy but rather good in its way a good quite forward elegant tannins resolved dry finish not so long bare lighter but with some extra spice a bit grippier than the 2000 quite complex and structured drinking quite nicely top black cherry hightoned tannic some doubts about the underlying concentration top very closed becomes honeyed and delicious needs decanting provence herbs bags of character fine attractive nose but the fruit while initially exciting is marred by a bitter twist towards the finish this defect seems less evident a day later while the wine seems quite mature i wonder if it might benefit from more time pretty good cashews yeasty bread honey creamy fruit a different character on returning each time taught acidity and good length really fine perhaps even brioche and honey nose quite citric lemon and grapefruit palate a little disjointed still but time will draw it together nicely softly frothy now as one might expect from its youth very good most of my recent notes of this wine have been from a single case bought at auction a while ago i have since discovered from the nice people at gosset that it is a 939495 blend lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and i suppose it is although i dont find it remotely a problem very rich but now in perfect balance quitelargeframed a bit coarse and difficult towards the finish perhaps a year in bottle would help ok but im not wild about this from a half bare doughy but floral nose quite tight dry and precise elegant palate decent length but with a touch of hardness that needs a year or two very good bare lost in my filing system this is from dinner at a byo restaurant a few months ago but i cant recall when mainstream chassagne pretty good a bit woody extravagent oak as often with grivot dry and austerely planky im not so keen others may like more very pleasant gamy old thing drink soon bare oozes minerality approachable but time will doubtless improve this very nice bare rasins a touch of oxidation sweet pruney palate ok but unremarkable lightweight almondy quite fine picquant and medicinal attractive as a lunchtime port a good elegant lightweight fresh and bright rather nice top very pale the colour has dropped out as sediment madeiralike nose pleasant port palate quite pale rather eveloved the level is bottomshoulder which might be the reason rather savoury and delicious but not quite what it ought to be i feel top very pale mushrooms and biscuits probably very old some paper labels claim some of these bottles as 1850s if any are its this one and past its best from different source and showing up all the previous wines lovely graceful old wine fruity and scented still fresh it develops in the glass and is completely delicious top nutty yeasty lovely mature champagne bare quite forward slightly fat 98 style completely healthy but for drinking top mineral clear fine a stunning effort for the vintage top still a touch hard but very fine probably substantially north african bare lovely mature claret perhaps even a bare dry very smoky quite baked fruit seems younger than its years gummy quite intense inyourface stuff rounded very deeply coloured rather good top very rancio cloudy and still so the next day rich and thick and with something of ozzie liquor muscat about it curious top yeasty very nice champagne quality although different in character tight lovely classic white burgundy rather evolved creamy marzipan very good but might have been better a few years ago top very much real wine this oozes strength and individuality might well improve further very nice makes an interesting comparison with the roda i prefer this because its much less international a good cassisy peppery fruit rather international but good of its sort very classic dry tannic hightoned top rich fruit elegant seems rather good this wine passed me by a bit i think i was chatting too much and concentrating not enough my main memory is jsut that it was very good still spicey rich very mc elegant lovely balance class always tells bare very marmaladey soft delicious i need to think more about this is it tokay somehow as it should be or is it turned into something else for the modern market im not sure yet and i need to drink a couple of glasses more contemplatively still its at least very impressive nicely shaped bottle and reasobale stuff inside it a bit coarse and woody and a bit too sweet i think ive had this for a few years its certainly worth keeping lovely honeyed and mineral palate a joy just goes to show that you shouldnt rush drinking champagne top ok but nothing out of the ordinary i havent had koonunga hill for ages i was pleasantly surprised very penfolds in style no bad thing to my mind velvety smooth not trying to be too big gentle on the head good nose but not typical a really very coarse palate rather fine fruit with just a touch of lychee not very varietal now more mineral some will say too old but i think its at a peak pleasingly dry too quite a fine wine is this just age or is this oldstyle zind before the days of extra residual sugar whatever its rather nice top tarry fragrant everything you could want from a typical good barolo in a decent but not special vintage needs drinking in the next few years top rather deliciously smooth and fragrantly softly volnay i noted after a while that this had been tarted up with quite a lot of new oak very good of its kind and quite good even in absolute terms lovely oldwine nose fresh fruit coarsened after 30 minutes or so and faded a bit still rather pleasant no indication on this half as to whether this was a riserva or anything bare nicely made fruity but not vulgar very drinkable bare no excessive 2003 flab although id like a bit more precision and minerality decent wine excellent fruit especially given the vintage gamy and mineral a lovely mouthful but the finish is a touch harsh still nice weight attractive fruit but it seemed a bit flabby maybe just a touch warm creamy fragrant delicate quite fine butterscotch background to greengage fruit completely fresh with a long finish magnum excellent tropicaledged very lemony fruit some oak i think nice balance and very rich big a bit modern but very good aiming at the beaucastel rousanne vv style perhaps very fizzy to the extent of being a fault but it wears off enough to form a judgement quite mineral and characterful serious wine that id like to try again at least a good lovely creamy fine acidity good length appetizing lovely a touch closed and struck matches too opens out great concentration a top nice rich fruit dry long top still red pinot noir from champagne so soft and silky gorgeously round easygoing one of the best nonburgundian pinots i have tasted top beetroot fruit harder than the previous wines very baked and extracted this is really not a success lots of grippy tannins highlywrought and oaky not my sort of thing but striking certainly needs time but what will happen very fine deep rich silky with a lovely refined dry palate splendid for vintage but could one regret the lack of cr typicity rich pineapple nice acid very pleasant bare lighter at the final analysis although more mouthfilling top bright both metaphorically and literally a touch hard on the finish still although coming round to drinking a touch short of the richness you might hope for from grahams in this vintage still worth acacia nuts intense dry long drinking but no hurry lime herbs cream not heavy on the palate lovely top big and muscular grand cru intensity and rich finish very good fragrant piquant cranberry yet meaty bovril nose excellent for the vintage partly on the basis of interest a bare promoted conversation apart from anything else putting a wax seal on an australian wine is making a statement a touch mineral quite complex fruit pure too and not overstated personally i still find an overlying minty sweetness in the finish not to my taste although that might be less noticable with the right food interesting wine that somebody with more of a taste for australian style might rate a bit more still fat nice botrytis a touch of paintstripper and not so long good less intense less flawed and follows through a bit better to the finish nice lightweight yet concentrated ethereal complex chocolatey fruit lovely these three wines were very kindly sent by the winery who had noticed that fwd isnt always very kind to beaujolais i tasted these with ljm sometime contributor to fwd im afraid that these three wines still failed to convince me completely about beaujolais but they have persuaded me that i need to try a few more earthy fresh fruity zingy nose with a hint of vanilla good texture on the palate my favourite of the three wines for drinking now im afraid i couldnt really get on with this wine it seemed light and dilute and was a touch green at the end possibly a faulty bottle so i wont score not rated quite a soft wine maturity taking over from the earlier gamay vibrancy i guess initially a bit dumb and subdued but after time the wine opened out it would be interesting to try this in another couple of years to see whether it is just at a bit of an inbetween phase for now excellent condition at 10 years old very good fruit too although for some reason i could not get that excited about it still a decent my last bottle of this and hasnt it kept well completely fresh but fully mature quite soft and very pleasingly drinkable very juicy with a touch of italianate bitterness to give it a grownup appeal finishes a touch abruptly perhaps a good a glass at valvonas vincafe even so clearly very elegant refined blanced and generally yummy very classy loads of fruit fairly forward drinking very nicely top on opening quite tough you have to like tannins for this it does have the most fantastic ripe fruit though and 24 hours after opening it had really opened out delicious easy this guy is one hell of a winemaker this has concentrated tarry raspberry fruit on the nose bags of tannins which are ripe enough to be enjoyable even at this stage super concentration and texture and a long finish hightoned despite being a bit more forward than the 96 excellent easily written from memory a day or two later surprisingly oldfashioned orangerimmed colour quite forward and easygoing drinking ok at the moment in fact but surely more time can only improve matters very classy quite dry fairly austere but very good particularly with some nibbles bare more forward and fragrant not really noticably sweeter good this is half chardonnay and half pinot meunier the latter not that apparent very yeasty seems a bit foursquare at the moment perhaps that is where one sees the pm rich and really very long clearly need quite a lot of time and i can see it could well be very good in a decade or so although it might be a bit light on finesse bare curious very exotic vanillan and highly vinous not everyones idea of champagne but you cant say it lacks character i need to drink this over an evening with food and see how my relationship with it develops for now a top dry real puligny quite intense not special but it does what it says on the tin quite rich mouthfilling wine lacks the classic finesse that marks out the stars top nice fruit pure intense a bit more oaky but quality fruit again seepage round the cork under the capsule odd but not undrinkable clearly faulty not rated depths depths and more depths really lovely both rich and piquant very top burnt dense exotic meaty tannic austere difficult this might yet come good and even now it is arresting and interesting drinking risky to rely on it evolving well but if all goes well attractive green rim never a bad sign on the palate like a really fine old madeira in every way except there is not the real intensity or searing acidity on the palate the flavours however are very fine and this is a lovely drink top chocolatey fruit very nice old colheita top possibly a touch too old now but lovely old champagne nonetheless mature and elegant for its depth one of the first wines i bought with a view to keeping i love old white burgundy and this didnt let me down lovely oily nutty ethereal stuff disappointing not past it but just not particularly special maybe it still needs loads more time to develop lovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose drinking very well silky ok so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage the label wasnt in the best condition the next morning i was just sorting through the corks when i noticed we had really been drinking the 1982 the last time i had this wine i was disappointed and i was again this time its ok but it hasnt got the structure or depth expected stylish nose slightly resinous a bit thin on the palate pleasant slightly flat flavoursome a bit rustic interesting up to a point rich fruit lovely burgundy good intensity and structure needs time top mothbally at first disjointed but intense palate emerges needs time will be great i suspect honied nose strong palate quite evolved ready in fact and needing drinking over the next few years i suspect even unflawed 96s seem to be aging quite quickly open peachy luxurious a little light some thought but i loved it coughsweet and smoky interesting but slightly harsh on the finish perhaps needs time grenachey cassis overtones quite raw finish a bit rubbery caramel nose a touch rough perhaps opens out quite classically chateauneuf top nice balance clearly warmvintage a lovely balance of slavours coming round to drinking quite fast a good yummy drinkability stands up in this company if a bit simple fragrant nose gummy rich very fine a touch woody pleasant persistent but perhaps a bit thin bare burnt a bit thin bare fragrant fruit a touch hard a touch of aniseed fairly lightweight top my memory of vintages of this provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet this though seems rather good provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box very much a point and it has kept well a little simple perhaps but i believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property good effort id like to try some other vintages quite concentrated and flavoursome but lacking finesse for me in a way that im not sure more time will alleviate pleasant then but not fantastic smoke and pepper fruit gently weakening perhaps but very drinkable blackberry and apple fruit with interesting sauvage overtones once open for a few hours very stylish indeed will probably improve for a year or two a bit stinky on opening it blows off to some extent but a touch of something foetid remains still quite a dense brownsugar palate follows with a hint of volatility or something good rather than exceptional fruity grassy like a new world semillon pleasant enough nice fruit quality quite suave decent length top very fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay very refined texture and good length once it has been open a while it seems even more burgundian it needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding scrapes slate sherbert a touch sour as msr wines can be good length maybe a touch hollow in the middle something i find occasionally with the vintage fine but not exceptional by the high standards of the domain top quite tight and closed but opens out with time as it warms up excellent intensity and a long brioche finish good balance very thin and dull drinkable but no stars modernstyled but very nicely done limey acidity satisfying but completely upstaged by the jobard that follows more reserved but much more complexity and beyondfruit flavours excellent dry reserved quite persistent rather good bare oxidised but it did have a slightly loose cork not rated softer and rounder than the lafarge below still quite piquant on the palate dry fragrant good length fairly austere at first and less flattering than the jadot wine might till improve touch while the jadot is ready open 24 hours seems good quite mineral sold to me in oddbins as the wine that beat dom perignon in a recent competition actually it might have been the nv blin that did this different assistants in oddbins attributed the result to both wines this wine is good but not dp good theres a touch of sweetness and some heaviness of hand good strawberry nose and pleasantly elegant palate drinkable rich quite forward sepcially for the vintage the quality shows in the persistence lovely junipergin edge to the nose a belnd of 95 and 96 strawberry fruit impressive at first but it does seem simple compared to the deutz weighty but not so intense good though for the price quite varietal but with an added complexity and some nonfruit chatracter that makes it stand out drinking very nicely top lighter and a touch vegetal a touch thin but nevertheless it is a wine of character top richer again as with the 93 you might struggle to spot the grape variety no bad thing in my mind an interesting mature wine very fine very characteristically southern rhone top really quite northern rhonelike and very stylish gamy syrah very complex smoky wine really lovely scrapes gamy but elegant a little overawed by the rayas wines but fine bare balanced and rich but perhaps not showing ideally now a little more time might help still very creamy but not rich dies a bit in the glass interesting and pretty good for an average vintage vineyard etc top difficult on opening gamy almost and austere opens out nicely top nicely set up and needing a bit of time yet i feel this hasnt the fineness to be great but it is very good
